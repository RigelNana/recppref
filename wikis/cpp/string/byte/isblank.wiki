int isblank( int ch );
}}

Checks if the given character is a blank character as classified by the currently installed C locale. Blank characters are whitespace characters used to separate words within a sentence. In the default C locale, only space ({{tt|0x20}}) and horizontal tab ({{tt|0x09}}) are classified as blank characters.

The behavior is undefined if the value of {{c|ch}} is not representable as {{c/core|unsigned char}} and is not equal to {{lc|EOF}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|ch|character to classify}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
Non-zero value if the character is a blank character, zero otherwise.

===Notes===
