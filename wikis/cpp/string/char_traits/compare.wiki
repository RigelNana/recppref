static int compare( const char_type* s1, const char_type* s2,
                    std::size_t count );
}}

Compares the first {{c|count}} characters of the character strings {{c|s1}} and {{c|s2}}. The comparison is done lexicographically.

If {{c|count}} is zero, strings are considered equal.

See {{named req|CharTraits}} for the general requirements on character traits for {{tt|X::compare}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|s1, s2|pointers to character strings to compare}}
{{par|count|the number of characters to compare from each character string}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
Negative value if {{c|s1}} is ''less than'' {{c|s2}}.

{{c|0}} if {{c|s1}} is ''equal to'' {{c|s2}}.

Positive value if {{c|s1}} is ''greater than'' {{c|s2}}.

===Complexity===
Linear in {{c|count}}.
