static char_type*
    copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );
}}

Copies {{c|count}} characters from the character string pointed to by {{c|src}} to the character string pointed to by {{c|dest}}.

If {{range|dest|dest + count}} and {{range|src|src + count}} overlap, the behavior is undefined.

See {{named req|CharTraits}} for the general requirements on character traits for {{tt|X::copy}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|dest|pointer to a character string to copy to}}
{{par|src|pointer to a character string to copy from}}
{{par|count|the number of characters to copy}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|dest}}

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.

===Complexity===
Linear in {{c|count}}.
