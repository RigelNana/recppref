The type mbstate_t is a trivial non-array type that can represent any of the conversion states that can occur in an implementation-defined set of supported multibyte character encoding rules. Zero-initialized value of {{tt|mbstate_t}} represents the initial conversion state, although other values of {{tt|mbstate_t}} may exist that also represent the initial conversion state.

Possible implementation of {{tt|mbstate_t}} is a struct type holding an array representing the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter indicating the number of bytes in the array that have been processed, and a representation of the current shift state.

The following functions should not be called from multiple threads without synchronization with the {{c|std::mbstate_t*}} argument of a null pointer due to possible data races: {{lc|std::mbrlen}}, {{lc|std::mbrtowc}}, {{lc|std::mbsrtowcs}}, {{lc|std::mbtowc}}, {{lc|std::wcrtomb}}, {{lc|std::wcsrtombs}}, {{lc|std::wctomb}}.
