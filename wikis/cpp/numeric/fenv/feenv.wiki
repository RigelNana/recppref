Manages the status of the floating-point environment.

@1@ Attempts to store the status of the floating-point environment in the object pointed to by {{tt|envp}}.

@2@ Attempts to establish the floating-point environment from the object pointed to by {{tt|envp}}. The value of that object must be previously obtained by a call to {{lc|std::feholdexcept}} or {{tt|std::fegetenv}} or be a floating-point macro constant. If any of the floating-point status flags are set in {{tt|envp}}, they become set in the environment (and are then testable with {{lc|std::fetestexcept}}), but the corresponding floating-point exceptions are not raised (execution continues uninterrupted)

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | envp | pointer to the object of type {{c|std::fenv_t}} which holds the status of the floating-point environment}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|0}} on success, non-zero otherwise.
