int feholdexcept( std::fenv_t* envp )
}}
{{dcl end}}

First, saves the current floating-point environment to the object pointed to by {{tt|envp}} (similar to {{lc|std::fegetenv}}), then clears all floating-point status flags, and then installs the non-stop mode: future floating-point exceptions will not interrupt execution (will not trap), until the floating-point environment is restored by {{lc|std::feupdateenv}} or {{lc|std::fesetenv}}.

This function may be used in the beginning of a subroutine that must hide the floating-point exceptions it may raise from the caller. If only some exceptions must be suppressed, while others must be reported, the non-stop mode is usually ended with a call to {{lc|std::feupdateenv}} after clearing the unwanted exceptions.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | envp | pointer to the object of type {{c|std::fenv_t}} where the floating-point environment will be stored}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|0}} on success, non-zero otherwise.
