1) Attempts to obtain the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are listed in the bitmask argument {{tt|excepts}}, which is a bitwise OR of the [[cpp/numeric/fenv/FE_exceptions|floating point exception macros]]. 

2) Attempts to copy the full contents of the floating-point exception flags that are listed in {{tt|excepts}} from {{tt|flagp}} into the floating-point environment. Does not raise any exceptions, only modifies the flags.

The full contents of a floating-point exception flag is not necessarily a boolean value indicating whether the exception is raised or cleared. For example, it may be a struct which includes the boolean status and the address of the code that triggered the exception. These functions obtain all such content and obtain/store it in {{tt|flagp}} in implementation-defined format.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | flagp | pointer to an {{c|std::fexcept_t}} object where the flags will be stored or read from}}
{{par | excepts | bitmask listing the exception flags to get/set}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|0}} on success, non-zero otherwise.
