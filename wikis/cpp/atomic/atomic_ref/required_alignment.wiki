The value of {{tt|required_alignment}} is the required alignment for an object to be referenced by an atomic reference, which is at least {{c|alignof(T)}}.

===Notes===
Hardware could require that an object to be referenced by an {{tt|atomic_ref&lt;T&gt;}} have stricter alignment than other {{tt|T}} objects, and whether operations on an {{tt|atomic_ref}} are lock-free can depend on the alignment of the referenced object.
