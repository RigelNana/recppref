Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of bitwise AND of the value and {{c|arg}}. This operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of {{c|order}}.

{{cpp/enable if|{{c/core|std::is_const_v&lt;T&gt;}} is {{c|false}}}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|arg|the other argument of bitwise AND}}
{{par|order|memory order constraints to enforce}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
The value of the referenced object, immediately preceding the effects of this function.

===Example===
{{example}}
