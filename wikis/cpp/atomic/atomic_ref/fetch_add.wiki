Atomically replaces the current value referenced by {{box|{{c/core|*}}{{rlpsi|/#ptr}}}} with the result of arithmetic addition of the value and {{c|arg}}. This operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of {{c|order}}.

* For signed integral types, arithmetic is defined to use twoâ€™s complement representation. There are no undefined results.
* For floating-point types, the [[cpp/numeric/fenv|floating-point environment]] in effect may be different from the calling thread's floating-point environment. The operation need not be conform to the corresponding {{lc|std::numeric_limits}} traits but is encouraged to do so. If the result is not a representable value for its type, the result is unspecified but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.
* For pointer types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operation otherwise has no undefined behavior.
** If {{c/core|std::remove_pointer_t&lt;T&gt;}} is not a complete object type, the program is ill-formed.

{{cpp/enable if|{{c/core|std::is_const_v&lt;T&gt;}} is {{c|false}}}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|arg|the other argument of arithmetic addition}}
{{par|order|memory order constraints to enforce}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
The value referenced by {{box|{{c/core|*}}{{rlpsi|/#ptr}}}}, immediately preceding the effects of this function.
