#define FLT_ROUNDS /* implementation defined */
}}

Specifies the current rounding direction of floating-point arithmetic operations.

{{dsc hitem | Value | Explanation}}
{{dsc | {{tt|-1}} | the default rounding direction is not known}}
{{dsc | {{tt|0}} | toward zero; same meaning as {{lc|FE_TOWARDZERO}} }}
{{dsc | {{tt|1}} | to nearest; same meaning as {{lc|FE_TONEAREST}} }}
{{dsc | {{tt|2}} | towards positive infinity; same meaning as {{lc|FE_UPWARD}} }}
{{dsc | {{tt|3}} | towards negative infinity; same meaning as {{lc|FE_DOWNWARD}} }}
{{dsc | other values | implementation-defined behavior}}
{{dsc end}}

===Notes===
The rounding mode can be changed with {{lc|std::fesetround}} and {{lc|FLT_ROUNDS}} reflects that change.

The possible values of FLT_ROUNDS match the possible values of {{lc|std::float_round_style}}, returned by {{lc|std::numeric_limits::round_style}}.
