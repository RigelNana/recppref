Returns a pointer to the underlying character array. The pointer is such that the range [data(), data() + size()) is valid and the values in it correspond to the values of the view. (n.b. Unlike {{tt|basic_string::data()}} and string literals, {{tt|data()}} may return a pointer to a buffer that is not null-terminated. Therefore it is typically a mistake to pass {{tt|data()}} to a routine that takes just a {{tt|const CharT*}} and expects a null-terminated string.)

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
A pointer to the underlying character array.

===Complexity===
Constant.
