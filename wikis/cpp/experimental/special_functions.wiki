{{fmbox|class=noprint|style=font-size: 0.8em|text='''Merged into ISO C++''' The functionality described on this page was merged into the mainline ISO C++ standard as of 3/2016, see [[cpp/numeric/special_functions|mathematical special functions]] {{mark since c++17}}}}

The Mathematical Special Functions library, ISO/IEC 29124:2010, specifies extensions to the C++ standard library that include mathematical special functions (originally part of ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007).

This special functions in this library are implemented in [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/math/doc/html/special.html boost.math], which is currently available on more compilers and platforms than implementations of this standard. At the time of this writing (1/2016) the only compiler that announced direct support is gcc, for version 6.1.
