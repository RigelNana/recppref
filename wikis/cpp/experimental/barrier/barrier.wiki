{{dcl begin}}
{{dcl | num=1 | since=concurrency | 1=

@1@ Constructs a {{tt|barrier}} for {{tt|num_threads}} participating threads. The set of participating threads is the first {{tt|num_threads}} threads to arrive at the synchronization point.
@2@ Copy constructor is deleted; {{tt|barrier}} is not copyable.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | num_threads | the number of participating threads for the barrier; must be non-negative }}
{{par end}}

=== Notes ===
If {{tt|num_threads}} is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and barrier can only be destroyed.
