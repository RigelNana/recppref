@1@ The file or empty directory identified by the path {{c|p}} is deleted as if by the POSIX [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/remove.html remove]. Symlinks are not followed (symlink is removed, not its target).
@2@ Deletes the contents of {{c|p}} (if it is a directory) and the contents of all its subdirectories, recursively, then deletes {{c|p}} itself as if by repeatedly applying the POSIX [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/remove.html remove]. Symlinks are not followed (symlink is removed, not its target).

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|p|path to delete}}
{{par|ec|out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
@1@ {{c|true}} if the file was deleted, {{c|false}} if it did not exist. The overload that takes {{c|error_code&amp;}} argument returns {{c|false}} on errors.
@2@ Returns the number of files and directories that were deleted (which may be zero if {{c|p}} did not exist to begin with). The overload that takes {{c|error_code&amp;}} argument returns {{c|static_cast&lt;std::uintmax_t&gt;(-1)}} on error.

===Exceptions===
{{cpp/experimental/fs/error_handling|p}}

===Notes===
On POSIX systems, this function typically calls {{tt|unlink}} and {{tt|rmdir}} as needed, on Windows {{tt|RemoveDirectoryW}} and {{tt|DeleteFileW}}.

===Example===
{{example
|code=
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;experimental/filesystem&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main()
{
    fs::path dir = fs::temp_directory_path();
    fs::create_directories(dir / "abcdef/example");
    std::uintmax_t n = fs::remove_all(dir / "abcdef");
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Deleted " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " files or directories\n";
}
|p=true
|output=
Deleted 2 files or directories
}}
