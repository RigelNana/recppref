Accesses the native path name as a character string.

@1@ Equivalent to {{c|native().c_str()}}.
@2@ Returns the native string representation of the pathname by reference.
@3@ Returns the native string representation of the pathname by value.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
The native string representation of the pathname, using native syntax, native character type, and native character encoding. This string is suitable for use with OS APIs.

===Exceptions===
@1,2@ {{unreviewed noexcept}}

===Notes===
The conversion function {{v|3}} is provided so that standard file-opening APIs that accept {{lc|std::basic_string}} file names, such as the {{lc|std::ifstream}} constructor, can use pathnames with no changes to code:
{{source|1=
fs::path p = "/tmp/text.txt";
std::ifstream f(p);
}}
