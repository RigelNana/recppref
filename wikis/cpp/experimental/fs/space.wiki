Determines the information about the filesystem on which the pathname {{c|p}} is located, as if by POSIX [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/statvfs.html {{tt|statvfs}}].

Populates and returns an object of type {{rlpt|space_info}}, set from the members of the POSIX {{tt|struct statvfs}} as follows:
* {{c|space_info.capacity}} is set as if by {{c|f_blocks * f_frsize}}.
* {{c|space_info.free}} is set to {{c|f_bfree * f_frsize}}.
* {{c|space_info.available}} is set to {{c|f_bavail * f_frsize}}.
* Any member that could not be determined is set to {{c|static_cast&lt;std::uintmax_t&gt;(-1)}}.

The non-throwing overload sets all members to {{c|static_cast&lt;std::uintmax_t&gt;(-1)}} on error.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|p|path to examine}}
{{par|ec|out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
The filesystem information (a {{rlpt|space_info}} object).

===Exceptions===
{{cpp/experimental/fs/error_handling|p}}

===Notes===
{{c|space_info.available}} may be less than {{c|space_info.free}}.
