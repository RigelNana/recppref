{{tt|directory_iterator}} is a {{named req|InputIterator}} that iterates over the {{ltt|cpp/experimental/fs/directory_entry|directory_entry}} elements of a directory (but does not visit the subdirectories). The iteration order is unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once. The special pathnames {{spar|dot}} and {{spar|dot-dot}} are skipped.

If the {{tt|directory_iterator}} is advanced past the last directory entry, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree after the directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.
