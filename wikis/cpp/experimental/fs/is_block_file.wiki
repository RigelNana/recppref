Checks if the given file status or path corresponds to a block special file, as if determined by the POSIX [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_stat.h.html S_ISBLK ]. Examples of block special files are block devices such as {{c|/dev/sda}} or {{c|/dev/loop0}} on Linux.

@1@ Equivalent to {{c|s.type() {{==}} file_type::block}}.
@2@ Equivalent to {{c|is_block_file(status(p))}} or {{c|is_block_file(status(p, ec))}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|s|file status to check}}
{{par|p|path to examine}}
{{par|ec|out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|true}} if the file indicated by {{c|p}} or if the type indicated {{c|s}} refers to a block device. The non-throwing overload returns {{c|false}} if an error occurs.

===Exceptions===
@1@ {{unreviewed noexcept}}
@2@ {{cpp/experimental/fs/error_handling|p}}

===Notes===
The information provided by this function is usually also provided as a byproduct of directory iteration. During directory iteration, calling {{tt|is_block_file(*iterator)}} is less efficient than {{tt|is_block_file(iterator-&gt;status())}}.
