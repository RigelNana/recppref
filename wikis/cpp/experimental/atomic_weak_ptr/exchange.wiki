Atomically replaces the underlying {{tt|weak_ptr}} with {{tt|desired}}. The operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of {{tt|order}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | desired | value to assign}}
{{par | order | memory order constraints to enforce}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
The value of the atomic variable before the call.
