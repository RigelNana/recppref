The struct {{tt|std::experimental::pmr::pool_options}} contains a set of constructor options for {{lc|std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource}} and {{lc|std::experimental::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource}}.

===Data members===
{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc mem obj | nolink=true | {{dsc small|std::size_t}} max_blocks_per_chunk | the maximum number of blocks that will be allocated at once from the upstream memory resource to replenish a pool}}
{{dsc mem obj | nolink=true | {{dsc small|std::size_t}} largest_required_pool_block | the largest allocation size that is required to be fulfilled through the pooling mechanism}}
{{dsc end}}

If the value of {{tt|max_blocks_per_chunk}} is zero or greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use a smaller value than is specified and may use different values for different pools.

If the value of {{tt|largest_required_pool_block}} is zero or greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may use a threshold greater than specified in this field.
