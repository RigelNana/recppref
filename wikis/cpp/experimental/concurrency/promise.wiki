{{tt|std::experimental::concurrency_v1::promise}} is a modified version of {{lc|std::promise}} provided by the concurrency TS that works with {{lc|std::experimental::future}}.

The only change from {{lc|std::promise}} is that the {{tt|get_future()}} member function returns a {{c|std::experimental::future}}.
