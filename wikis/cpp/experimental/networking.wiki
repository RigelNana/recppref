{{title|Extensions for networking}}
{{cpp/experimental/networking/navbar}}

The C++ Extensions for Networking, ISO/IEC TS 19216:2018, defines new components for the C++ standard library listed on this page.

The Networking TS is based on the C++14 standard as modified by [[cpp/experimental/lib extensions|version 1 of the Library Fundamentals TS]]. Its design is based on the [https://think-async.com/Asio Asio library].

====Library named requirements====
The following named requirements are used in the normative text of the Networking TS to define the expectations of the library. The burden is on the programmer to ensure that library templates are instantiated with template arguments that satisfy these requirements. Failure to do so may result in very complex compiler diagnostics or in undefined behavior at runtime.
