A utility metafunction that maps a sequence of any types to the type {{c|void}}.

===Notes===
This utility metafunction is used in template metaprogramming to detect ill-formed types in [[cpp/language/sfinae|SFINAE]] context. First voted into C++17 as {{lc|std::void_t}}, it was later added as well to the library fundamentals TS as {{tt|std::experimental::void_t}}, because it is a dependency of the [[cpp/experimental/is_detected|detection idiom]] and the LFTS v2 is based on C++14.
