{{ddcl | since=libfund_ts_3 |
void release() noexcept;
}}

Releases the ownership of the managed resource if any. The destructor will not execute the deleter after the call, unless {{lc|reset}} is called later for managing new resource.

Unlike {{lc|std::unique_ptr::release}}, this function is not required to modify the stored resource handle.
