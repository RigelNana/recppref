{{title|C++ standard libraries extensions, version 3}}
{{cpp/experimental/lib_extensions_3/navbar}}

Version 3 of the C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals, ISO/IEC TS 19568:2024, defines the following new components for the C++ standard library, in addition to those defined in [[cpp/experimental/lib extensions|version 1]] and [[cpp/experimental/lib extensions 2|version 2]].

Components merged into C++17/20 and the following components are removed in LFTS v3:
* {{lc|std::experimental::make_array}},
* {{lc|std::experimental::erased_type}},
* {{ltt|cpp/experimental/lib_extensions/packaged_task|std::experimental::packaged_task}}, and
* {{ltt|cpp/experimental/lib_extensions/promise|std::experimental::promise}}.

===Scope guard===
{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc header | experimental/scope}}
{{dsc inc | cpp/experimental/dsc scope_exit}}
{{dsc inc | cpp/experimental/dsc scope_fail}}
{{dsc inc | cpp/experimental/dsc scope_success}}
{{dsc inc | cpp/experimental/dsc unique_resource}}
{{dsc end}}

===Feature test macros===
{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc header | experimental/memory_resource }}
{{dsc macro const | __cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources | nolink=true | a value of at least {{c|201803}} indicates that {{ltt|cpp/experimental/resource_adaptor}} is supported }}
{{dsc header | experimental/functional }}
{{dsc macro const | __cpp_lib_experimental_function_polymorphic_allocator | nolink=true | a value of at least {{c|202211}} indicates that {{c|std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;}} is used for {{ltt|cpp/experimental/function|std::experimental::function}} }}
{{dsc header | experimental/scope}}
{{dsc macro const | __cpp_lib_experimental_scope | nolink=true | a value of at least {{c|201902}} indicates that the scope guards are supported }}
{{dsc end}}

===Notes===
The value of {{tt|__cpp_lib_experimental_memory_resources}} has been increased in LFTS v3, because the design of {{ltt|cpp/experimental/resource_adaptor}} is rebased onto {{lc|std::pmr::memory_resource}}.
