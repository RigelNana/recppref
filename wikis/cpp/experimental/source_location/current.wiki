Constructs a new {{tt|source_location}} object. 

=== Return value ===
If {{tt|current()}} is invoked directly (via a function call that names {{tt|current()}}),  it returns a {{tt|source_location}} object with implementation-defined values representing the location of the call. The values should be affected by the [[cpp/preprocessor/line|{{tt|#line}} preprocessor directive]] in the same manner as the predefined macros {{c|__LINE__}} and {{c|__FILE__}}.

If {{tt|current()}} is invoked in any other manner, the return value is unspecified.

=== Remarks ===

If {{tt|current()}} is used in an [[cpp/language/data_members#Member initialization|initializer for a non-static data member]], the return value corresponds to the location of the constructor or [[cpp/language/aggregate_initialization|aggregate initialization]] that initializes the data member.

=== Notes ===

When {{tt|current()}} is used in a default argument, the return value will correspond to the location of the call to {{tt|current()}} at the call site.

===Parameters===
(none)
