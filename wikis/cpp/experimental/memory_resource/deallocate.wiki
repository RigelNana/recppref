}}

Deallocates the storage pointed to by {{c|p}}. {{c|p}} shall have been returned by a prior call to {{tt|allocate(bytes, alignment)}} on a {{tt|memory_resource}} that compares equal to {{c|*this}}, and the storage it points to shall not yet have been deallocated.

Equivalent to {{c|return do_deallocate(p, bytes, alignment);}}.
