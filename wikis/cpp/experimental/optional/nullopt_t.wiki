{{tt|std::experimental::nullopt_t}} is an empty class type used to indicate {{tt|optional}} type with uninitialized state. In particular, {{c|std::experimental::optional}} has a constructor with {{tt|nullopt_t}} as a single argument, which creates an optional that does not contain a value.

{{tt|std::experimental::nullopt_t}} must be a {{named req|LiteralType}} and cannot have a default constructor.

It must have a {{tt|constexpr}} constructor that takes some implementation-defined literal type.

===Notes===
{{tt|nullopt_t}} is not {{named req|DefaultConstructible}} to support both {{c|1=op = {};}} and {{c|1=op = nullopt;}} as the syntax for disengaging an optional object. 

A possible implementation of this class is
{{source|
struct nullopt_t
{
    constexpr nullopt_t(int) {}
};
}}
