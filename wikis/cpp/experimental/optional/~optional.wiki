If the object contains a value and the type {{tt|T}} is not trivially destructible (see {{lc|std::is_trivially_destructible}}), destroys the contained value by calling its destructor, as if by {{c|val-&gt;T::~T()}}.

Otherwise, does nothing.

===Notes===
If {{tt|T}} is trivially-destructible, then this destructor is also trivial, so {{tt|optional&lt;T&gt;}} is also trivially-destructible.
