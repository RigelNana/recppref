The class {{tt|any}} describes a type-safe container for single values of any type.

@1@ An object of class {{tt|any}} stores an instance of any type that satisfies the constructor requirements or is empty, and this is referred to as the ''state'' of the class {{tt|any}} object. The stored instance is called the contained object. Two states are equivalent if they are either both empty or if both are not empty and if the contained objects are equivalent.

@2@ The non-member {{tt|any_cast}} functions provide type-safe access to the contained object.

Implementations are encouraged to avoid dynamic allocations for small objects, but such an optimization may only be applied to types that for which {{lc|std::is_nothrow_move_constructible}} returns {{c|true}}.
