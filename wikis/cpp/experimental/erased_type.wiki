The class {{tt|erased_type}} is an empty struct that serves as a placeholder for a type in situations where the actual type is determined at runtime. For example, in classes that use [[cpp/experimental/memory|type-erased allocators]], the nested typedef {{tt|allocator_type}} is an alias for {{tt|erased_type}}.

===Notes===
{{tt|erased_type}} is removed in LFTS v3 because {{c|std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;}} is preferable for type erasure.
