{{c|native&lt;T&gt;}} is an implementation-defined alias for an ABI tag. This is the primary ABI tag to use for efficient explicit vectorization.

===Notes===

The intent is to use the ABI tag producing the most efficient data-parallel execution for the element type T that is supported on the currently targeted system. For target architectures without ISA extensions, the {{c|native&lt;T&gt;}} and {{c|compatible&lt;T&gt;}} aliases will likely be the same. For target architectures with ISA extensions, compiler flags may influence the {{c|native&lt;T&gt;}} alias while {{c|compatible&lt;T&gt;}} will be the same independent of such flags.
