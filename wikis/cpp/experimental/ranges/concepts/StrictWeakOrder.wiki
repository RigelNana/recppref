The concept {{tt|StrictWeakOrder&lt;R, T, U&gt;}} specifies that the {{rconcept|Relation}} {{tt|R}} imposes a strict weak ordering on its arguments. A relation {{tt|r}} is a strict weak ordering if
* it is irreflexive: for all {{tt|x}}, {{tt|r(x, x)}} is false;
* it is transitive: for all {{tt|a}}, {{tt|b}} and {{tt|c}}, if {{tt|r(a, b)}} and {{tt|r(b, c)}} are both true then {{tt|r(a, c)}} is true;
* let {{tt|e(a, b)}} be {{tt|!r(a, b) &amp;&amp; !r(b, a)}}, then {{tt|e}} is transitive: {{tt|e(a, b) &amp;&amp; e(b, c)}} implies {{tt|e(a, c)}}.

Under these conditions, it can be shown that {{tt|e}} is an equivalence relation, and {{tt|r}} induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence classes determined by {{tt|e}}.

===Notes===
The distinction between {{rconcept|Relation}} and {{tt|StrictWeakOrder}} is purely semantic.
