The concept {{tt|Copyable&lt;T&gt;}} specifies that {{tt|T}} is an {{rconcept|Movable}} object type that can also copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy assignment).

===Notes===
It is intended that {{tt|Copyable&lt;T&gt;}} also requires {{c|Assignable&lt;T&amp;, const T&gt;}} (assignment from const rvalue) and {{c|Assignable&lt;T&amp;, T&amp;&gt;}} (assignment from non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.
