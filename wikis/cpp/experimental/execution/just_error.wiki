===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|error|input error which will be injected and returned by the receiver.}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
Returns a sender with no completion schedulers, which sends the provided values.

===Notes===
If the provided error is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent to the receiver’s {{lc|set_error}}. If the provided value is an rvalue reference, it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is sent to the receiver’s {{tt|set_error}}.
