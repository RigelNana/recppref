execution::sender auto then(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable&lt;values-sent-by(input)...&gt; function
);
}}

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|input|sender which once executed sends the values upon which the function executes}}
{{par|function|invocable to be called by the new sender chained to the input sender}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
Returns a sender describing the task graph described by the input sender, with an added node of invoking the provided function with the values sent by the input sender as arguments.

{{tt|then}} is guaranteed to not begin executing function until the returned sender is started.

===Example===
Possible usage of {{tt|execution::then}}.
{{source|1=
execution::sender auto input = get_input();
execution::sender auto snd = execution::then(input, [](auto... args)
{
    std::print(args...);
});
// snd describes the work described by pred
// followed by printing all of the values sent by pred
