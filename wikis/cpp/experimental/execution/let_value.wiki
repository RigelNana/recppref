execution::sender auto let_value(
    execution::sender auto input,
    std::invocable&lt;values-sent-by(input)...&gt; function
);
}}

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|input|sender which once executed sends the values upon which the function executes}}
{{par|function|invocable to be called with the values from the input sender}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
Returns a sender describing the task graph described by the input sender, with an added node of invoking the provided function with the values sent by the input sender as arguments.

{{tt|let_value}} is similar to {{lc|then}}, however, where the sender returned from {{tt|then}} sends exactly what that function ends up returning - {{tt|let_value}} requires that the function returns a sender, and the sender returned by {{tt|let_value}} sends the values sent by the sender returned from the callback.
