void count_down_and_wait();

Atomically decrements the internal counter by {{tt|1}} and (if necessary) blocks the calling 
thread until the counter reaches zero.

The behavior is undefined if the internal counter is already zero.

This operation [[cpp/atomic/memory_order#Happens-before|synchronizes with]] all calls that block on this latch and all {{ltt|cpp/experimental/latch/is_ready}} calls on this latch that returns {{tt|true}}.

===Parameters===
