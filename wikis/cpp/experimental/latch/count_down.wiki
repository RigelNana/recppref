void count_down( ptrdiff_t n = 1 );

Atomically decrements the internal counter by {{c|n}} without blocking the caller.

If {{c|n}} is greater than the value of the internal counter or is negative, the behavior is undefined.

This operation [[cpp/atomic/memory_order#Happens-before|synchronizes with]] all calls that block on this latch and all {{ltt|cpp/experimental/latch/is_ready}} calls on this latch that returns {{c|true}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|n|the value by which the internal counter is decreased}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
(none)

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.
