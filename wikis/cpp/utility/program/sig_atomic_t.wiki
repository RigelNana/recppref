typedef /* unspecified */ sig_atomic_t;
}}

An integer type which can be accessed as an atomic entity even in the presence of asynchronous interrupts made by signals.

===Notes===
Until C++11, which introduced {{lc|std::atomic}} and {{lc|std::atomic_signal_fence}}, about the only thing a strictly conforming program could do in a signal handler was to assign a value to a {{c|volatile static std::sig_atomic_t}} variable and promptly return.
