typedef /* unspecified */ jmp_buf;
}}

The {{tt|std::jmp_buf}} type is an array type suitable for storing information to restore a calling environment. The stored information is sufficient to restore execution at the correct block of the program and invocation of that block. The state of floating-point status flags, or open files, or any other data is not stored in an object of type {{tt|std::jmp_buf}}.
