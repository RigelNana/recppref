std::string source_file() const;
}}

Returns the presumed or actual name of the source file that lexically contains the expression or statement whose evaluation is represented by {{c|*this}}, or an empty string on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when {{c|*this}} is empty.

Either {{tt|source_file}} returns the presumed source file name and {{rlpt|source_line}} returns the presumed line number, or {{tt|source_file}} returns the actual source file name and {{rlpt|source_line}} returns the actual line number.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
The name of the source file specified above on success, an empty string on failure other than allocation failure.

===Exceptions===
Throws {{lc|std::bad_alloc}} if memory for the internal data structures or the resulting string cannot be allocated.

===Notes===
The presumed name of the source file is what the predefined macro {{ltt|cpp/preprocessor/replace|__FILE__}} expands to, and can be changed by the {{ltt|cpp/preprocessor/line|#line}} directive.

{{todo|definition of "actual name" is missing ({{lwg|3507}})}}

Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more time than the allocation.
