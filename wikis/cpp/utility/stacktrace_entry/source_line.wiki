{{ddcl | since=c++23 |
std::uint_least32_t source_line() const;
}}

Returns a 1-based line number that lexically relates to the evaluation represented by {{c|*this}}, or 0 on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when {{c|*this}} is empty.

Either {{rlpt|source_file}} returns the presumed source file name and {{tt|source_line}} returns the presumed line number, or {{rlpt|source_file}} returns the actual source file name and {{tt|source_line}} returns the actual line number.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
The line number specified above on success, 0 on failure other than allocation failure.

===Exceptions===
Throws {{lc|std::bad_alloc}} if memory for the internal data structures cannot be allocated.

===Notes===
The presumed line number is what the predefined macro {{ltt|cpp/preprocessor/replace|__LINE__}} expands to, and can be changed by the {{ltt|cpp/preprocessor/line|#line}} directive.

{{todo|definition of "actual line number" is missing ({{lwg|3507}})}}

This function is not required to be {{c|noexcept}} because getting source line requires allocation on some platforms.
