std::string description() const;
}}

Returns a description of the evaluation represented by {{c|*this}} on success, or an empty string on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when {{c|*this}} is empty.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
A description of the represented evaluation on success, an empty string on failure other than allocation failure.

===Exceptions===
Throws {{lc|std::bad_alloc}} if memory for the internal data structures or the resulting string cannot be allocated.

===Notes===
Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more time than the allocation.
