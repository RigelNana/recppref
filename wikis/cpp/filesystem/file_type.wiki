{{dsc | {{tt|directory}} | a directory}}
{{dsc | {{tt|symlink}} | a symbolic link}}
{{dsc | {{tt|block}} | a block special file}}
{{dsc | {{tt|character}} | a character special file}}
{{dsc | {{tt|fifo}} | a FIFO (also known as pipe) file}}
{{dsc | {{tt|socket}} | a socket file}}
{{dsc | implementation-defined | an additional implementation-defined constant for each additional file type supported by the implementation  (e.g. MSVC STL defines {{c|junction}} for [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/junction NTFS junctions])}}
{{dsc | {{tt|unknown}} | the file exists but its type could not be determined}}
