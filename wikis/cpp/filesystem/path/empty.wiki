Checks if the path in generic format is empty.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
{{c|true}} if the path is empty, {{c|false}} otherwise.

===Notes===
An empty path can be obtained by calling {{ltt|cpp/filesystem/path/clear|clear}} and by default-constructing a {{tt|path}}. It can also be returned by a path decomposition function (such as {{ltt|cpp/filesystem/path/extension|extension}}) if the corresponding component is not present in the path.

An empty path is classified as a relative path.
