std::jthread&amp; operator=( std::jthread&amp;&amp; other ) noexcept;
}}

If {{c|*this}} still has an associated running thread (i.e. {{c|1=joinable() == true}}), calls {{c|request_stop()}} followed by {{c|join()}}. Assigns the state of {{c|other}} to {{c|*this}} and sets {{c|other}} to a default constructed state.

After this call, {{c|this-&gt;get_id()}} is equal to the value of {{c|other.get_id()}} prior to the call and the associated stop-state is also moved, and {{c|other}} no longer represents a thread of execution nor has any stop-state.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|other|another {{tt|jthread}} object to assign to this {{tt|jthread}} object}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|*this}}
