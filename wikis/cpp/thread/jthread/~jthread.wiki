~jthread();
}}

Destroys the {{tt|jthread}} object.

If {{c|*this}} has an associated thread ({{c|1=joinable() == true}}), calls {{lc|request_stop()}} and then {{lc|join()}}.

===Notes===
The {{lc|request_stop()}} has no effect if the {{tt|jthread}} was previously requested to stop.

A {{tt|jthread}} object does not have an associated thread after
* it was default-constructed.
* it was moved from.
* {{lc|join()}} has been called.
* {{lc|detach()}} has been called.

If {{lc|join()}} throws an exception (e.g. because deadlock is detected), {{lc|std::terminate()}} may be called.
