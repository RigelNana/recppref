std::future&lt;R&gt; get_future();
}}

Returns a future object associated with the same shared state as {{c|*this}}. 

An exception is thrown if {{c|*this}} has no shared state or {{tt|get_future}} has already been called. To get multiple "pop" ends of the promise-future communication channel, use {{lc|std::future::share}}.

Calls to this function do not introduce data races with calls to {{lc|set_value}}, {{lc|set_exception}}, {{lc|set_value_at_thread_exit}}, or {{lc|set_exception_at_thread_exit}} (therefore they need not synchronize with each other).

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
A future referring to the shared state of {{c|*this}}.

===Exceptions===
{{lc|std::future_error}} on the following conditions:

* {{c|*this}} has no shared state. The error code is set to {{ltt|cpp/thread/future_errc|no_state}}.

* {{tt|get_future()}} has already been called on a promise with the same shared state as {{c|*this}}. The error code is set to {{ltt|cpp/thread/future_errc|future_already_retrieved}}.
