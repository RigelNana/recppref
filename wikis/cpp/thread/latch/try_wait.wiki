bool try_wait() const noexcept;
}}
{{dcl end}}

Returns {{c|true}} only if the internal counter has reached zero. This function may spuriously return {{c|false}} with very low probability even if the internal counter has reached zero.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
With very low probability {{c|false}}, otherwise {{c|1=cnt == 0}}, where {{tt|cnt}} is the value of the internal counter.

===Notes===
The reason why a spurious result is permitted is to allow implementations to use a memory order more relaxed than {{lc|std::memory_order_seq_cst}}.
