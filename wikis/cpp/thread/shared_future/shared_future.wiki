Constructs a new {{tt|shared_future}}.

@1@ Default constructor. Constructs an empty shared future, that doesn't refer to a shared state, that is {{c|1=valid() == false}}.
@2@ Constructs a shared future that refers to the same shared state, if any, as {{c|other}}.
@3,4@ Transfers the shared state held by {{c|other}} to {{c|*this}}. After the construction, {{c|1=other.valid() == false}}, and {{c|this-&gt;valid()}} returns the same value as {{c|other.valid()}} would have returned before the construction.

===Parameters===

{{par|other|another future object to initialize with}}
