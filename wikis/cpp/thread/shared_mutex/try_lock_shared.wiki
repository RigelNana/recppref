{{dcl | since=c++17 |
bool try_lock_shared();
}}
{{dcl end}}

Tries to lock the mutex in shared mode. Returns immediately. On successful lock acquisition returns {{c|true}}, otherwise returns {{c|false}}.

This function is allowed to fail spuriously and return {{c|false}} even if the mutex is not currenly exclusively locked by any other thread.

A prior {{lc|unlock()}} operation on the same mutex ''synchronizes-with'' (as defined in {{lc|std::memory_order}}) this operation if it returns {{c|true}}.

The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex in any mode.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
{{c|true}} if the lock was acquired successfully, otherwise {{c|false}}.

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.

===Example===
