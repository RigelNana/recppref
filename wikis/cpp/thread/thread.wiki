class thread;

The class {{tt|thread}} represents [[enwiki:Thread_(computing)|a single thread of execution]]. Threads allow multiple functions to execute concurrently. 

Threads begin execution immediately upon construction of the associated thread object (pending any OS scheduling delays), starting at the top-level function provided as a [[cpp/thread/thread/thread|constructor argument]]. The return value of the top-level function is ignored and if it terminates by throwing an exception, {{lc|std::terminate}} is called. The top-level function may communicate its return value or an exception to the caller via {{lc|std::promise}} or by modifying shared variables (which may require synchronization, see {{lc|std::mutex}} and {{lc|std::atomic}}).

{{tt|std::thread}} objects may also be in the state that does not represent any thread (after default construction, move from, {{lc|detach}}, or {{lc|join}}), and a thread of execution may not be associated with any {{tt|thread}} objects (after {{lc|detach}}).

No two {{tt|std::thread}} objects may represent the same thread of execution; {{tt|std::thread}} is not {{named req|CopyConstructible}} or {{named req|CopyAssignable}}, although it is {{named req|MoveConstructible}} and {{named req|MoveAssignable}}.
