@1@ Constructs the mutex. The mutex is in unlocked state after the constructor completes.

@2@ Copy constructor is deleted.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Notes===
Because the default constructor is {{c|constexpr}}, static mutexes are initialized as part of [[cpp/language/initialization#Non-local_variables|static non-local initialization]], before any dynamic non-local initialization begins. This makes it safe to lock a mutex in a constructor of any static object.
