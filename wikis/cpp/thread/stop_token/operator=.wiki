Replaces the associated stop-state with that of {{c|other}}.

@1@ Copy-assigns the associated stop-state of {{c|other}} to that of {{c|*this}}. Equivalent to {{c|stop_token(other).swap(*this)}}.
@2@ Move-assigns the associated stop-state of {{c|other}} to that of {{c|*this}}. After the assignment, {{c|*this}} contains the previous associated stop-state of {{c|other}}, and {{c|other}} has no associated stop-state. Equivalent to {{c|stop_token(std::move(other)).swap(*this)}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|other|another {{tt|stop_token}} object to share the stop-state with to or acquire the stop-state from}}
{{par end}}
