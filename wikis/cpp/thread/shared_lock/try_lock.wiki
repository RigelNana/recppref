* Any exceptions thrown by {{c|mutex()-&gt;try_lock_shared()}}.

* If there is no associated mutex, {{lc|std::system_error}} with an error code of {{lc|std::errc::operation_not_permitted}}.

* If the mutex is already locked, {{lc|std::system_error}} with an error code of {{lc|std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur}}.
