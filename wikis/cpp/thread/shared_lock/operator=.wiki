Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of {{c|other}} using move semantics. 

If, prior to this call, {{c|*this}} has an associated mutex (({{lc|mutex()}} returns a non-null pointer) and has acquired ownership of it ({{lc|owns()}} returns {{c|true}}), the mutex is unlocked by calling {{lc|std::shared_mutex::unlock_shared|unlock_shared()}}.

After this call, {{c|other}} has no associated mutex.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|other|another {{tt|shared_lock}} to replace the state with}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|*this}}
