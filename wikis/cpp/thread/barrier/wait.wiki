void wait( arrival_token&amp;&amp; arrival ) const;
}}

If {{c|arrival}} is associated with the phase synchronization point for the current phase of {{c|*this}}, blocks at the synchronization point associated with {{c|arrival}} until the phase completion step of the synchronization point's phase is run.

Otherwise, if {{c|arrival}} is associated with the phase synchronization point for the immediately preceding phase of {{c|*this}}, returns immediately.

Otherwise, i.e. if {{c|arrival}} is associated with the phase synchronization point for an earlier phase of {{c|*this}} or any phase of a barrier object other than {{c|*this}}, the behavior is undefined.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|arrival|an {{tt|arrival_token}} obtained by a previous call to {{rlpt|arrive}} on the same {{tt|barrier}}}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
(none)

===Exceptions===
Throws {{lc|std::system_error}} with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.
