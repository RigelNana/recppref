}}

Constructs an {{tt|arrival_token}} object associated with the phase synchronization point for the current phase. Then, decrements the expected count by {{c|n}}.

This function executes atomically. The call to this function [[cpp/atomic/memory_order#Strongly happens-before|strongly happens-before]] the start of the phase completion step for the current phase.

The behavior is undefined if {{c|n}} is less than or equal to 0 or greater than the expected count for the current barrier phase.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|n|the value by which the expected count is decreased}}
{{par end}}

The constructed {{tt|arrival_token}} object.
