~thread();
}}

Destroys the thread object.

If {{c|*this}} has an associated thread ({{c|1=joinable() == true}}), {{c|std::terminate()}} is called.

===Notes===
A thread object does not have an associated thread (and is safe to destroy) after
* it was default-constructed.
* it was moved from.
* {{lc|join()}} has been called.
* {{lc|detach()}} has been called.

===Example===
{{example
|code=
#include &lt;thread&gt;
using namespace std::chrono_literals;

int main()
{
    auto bleah = std::thread{[]{ std::this_thread::sleep_for(13ms); }&lt;!----&gt;};

}   // ~thread calls std::terminate()
|p=true
|output=
terminate called without an active exception
}}
