{{ddcl|since=c++11|1=
thread&amp; operator=( thread&amp;&amp; other ) noexcept;
}}

If {{c|*this}} still has an associated running thread (i.e. {{c|1=joinable() == true}}), calls {{c|std::terminate()}}. Otherwise, assigns the state of {{c|other}} to {{c|*this}} and sets {{c|other}} to a default constructed state.

After this call, {{rlp|get_id|{{c|this-&gt;get_id()}}}} is equal to the value of {{rlp|get_id|{{c|other.get_id()}}}} prior to the call, and {{c|other}} no longer represents a thread of execution.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|other|another thread object to assign to this thread object}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|*this}}
