The class {{tt|thread::id}} is a lightweight, trivially copyable class that serves as a unique identifier of {{lc|std::thread}} {{rev inl|since=c++20|and {{lc|std::jthread}}}} objects. 

Instances of this class may also hold the special distinct value that does not represent any thread. Once a thread has finished, the value of {{tt|std::thread::id}} may be reused by another thread.

This class is designed for use as key in associative containers, both ordered and unordered.
