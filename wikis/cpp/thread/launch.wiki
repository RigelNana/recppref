{{tt|std::launch}} is a {{named req|BitmaskType}}. It specifies the launch policy for a task executed by the {{lc|std::async}} function.

===Constants===
The following constants denoting individual bits are defined by the standard library:

{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc hitem|Name|Explanation}}
{{dsc|{{tt|async}}|the task is executed on a different thread, potentially by creating and launching it first}}
{{dsc|{{tt|deferred}}|the task is executed on the calling thread the first time its result is requested (lazy evaluation)}}
{{dsc end}}

In addition, implementations are allowed to:
* define additional bits and bitmasks to specify restrictions on task interactions applicable to a subset of launch policies, and
* enable those additional bitmasks for the first (default) overload of {{lc|std::async}}.
