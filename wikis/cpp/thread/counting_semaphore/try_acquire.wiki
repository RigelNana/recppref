Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by {{c|1}} if it is greater than {{c|0}}; no blocking occurs regardless.

===Return value===
{{c|true}} if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise {{c|false}}.

===Notes===
Implementations are allowed to fail to decrement the counter even if it was greater than {{c|0}} - i.e., they are allowed to spuriously fail and return {{c|false}}.
