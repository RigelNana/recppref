Destroys the {{tt|counting_semaphore}} object. 

===Notes===
It is only safe to invoke the destructor if all threads have been notified. The programmer must ensure that no threads attempt to wait on {{c|*this}} once the destructor has been started. The destructor does not notify and release any waiting threads.
