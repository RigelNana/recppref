The class template {{tt|basic_ostream}} provides support for high level output operations on character streams. The supported operations include formatted output (e.g. integer values) and unformatted output (e.g. raw characters and character arrays). This functionality is implemented in terms of the interface provided by the {{tt|basic_streambuf}} class, accessed through the {{tt|basic_ios}} base class. In typical implementations, {{tt|basic_ostream}} has no non-inherited data members.
