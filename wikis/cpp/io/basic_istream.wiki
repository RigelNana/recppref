}}

The class template {{tt|basic_istream}} provides support for high level input operations on character streams. The supported operations include formatted input (e.g. integer values or whitespace-separated characters and characters strings) and unformatted input (e.g. raw characters and character arrays). This functionality is implemented in terms of the interface provided by the underlying {{tt|basic_streambuf}} class, accessed through the {{tt|basic_ios}} base class. The only non-inherited data member of {{tt|basic_istream}}, in most implementations, is the value returned by {{l2tf|cpp/io/basic_istream/gcount}}.
