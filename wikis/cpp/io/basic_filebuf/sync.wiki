If a put area exists (e.g. the file was opened for writing), calls {{lc|overflow()}} to write all pending output to the file, then flushes the file as if by calling {{lc|std::fflush}}.

If a get area exists (e.g. the file was opened for reading), the effect is implementation-defined. Typical implementation may empty out the get area and move the current file position back by the corresponding number of bytes.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
{{c|0}} in case of success, {{c|-1}} in case of failure.

===Notes===
{{tt|sync()}} or its equivalent is implicitly called for output streams by {{rlpt|close|close()}}, {{rlpt|seekoff|seekoff()}}, and {{rlpt|seekpos|seekpos()}} and explicitly called by {{lc|std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()}}

===Example===
{{example
