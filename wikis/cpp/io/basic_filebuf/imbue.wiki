{{ddcl |
protected:
virtual void imbue( const std::locale&amp; loc )
}}

Changes the associated locale so that all characters inserted or extracted after this call (and until another call to {{tt|imbue()}}) are converted using the {{lc|std::codecvt}} facet of {{tt|loc}}.

If the old locale's encoding is state-dependent and file is not positioned at the beginning, then the new locale must have the same {{lc|std::codecvt}} facet as the one previously imbued.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | loc | the locale to imbue the stream with}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
(none)

===Example===
{{example

 | code=
 | output=
