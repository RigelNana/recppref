The class {{tt|std::basic_ios}} provides facilities for interfacing with objects that have {{lc|std::basic_streambuf}} interface. Several {{tt|std::basic_ios}} objects can refer to one actual {{tt|std::basic_streambuf}} object.

===Notes===
Straightforward implementation of {{tt|std::basic_ios}} stores only the following members (which all depend on the template parameters and thus cannot be part of {{lc|std::ios_base}}):
* the fill character (see {{rlt|fill|fill()}})
* the tied stream pointer (see {{rlt|tie|tie()}})
* the associated stream buffer pointer (see {{rlt|rdbuf|rdbuf()}}).

Actual implementations vary:

Microsoft Visual Studio stores just those three members.

LLVM libc++ stores 1 less member: it maintains the {{tt|rdbuf}} pointer as a {{c/core|void*}} member of {{tt|ios_base}}.

GNU libstdc++ stores 4 additional members: three cached facets and a flag to indicate that fill was initialized.

&lt;!-- should I even bother with Oracle which plays dumb and maintains the iostate and the exception mask all in here instead of ios_base? --&gt;
