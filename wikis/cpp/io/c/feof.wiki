int feof( std::FILE* stream );
}}

Checks if the end of the given file stream has been reached.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|stream|the file stream to check}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
Nonzero value if the end of the stream has been reached, otherwise {{c|0}}.

===Notes===
This function only reports the stream state as reported by the most recent I/O operation, it does not examine the associated data source. For example, if the most recent I/O was a {{lc|std::fgetc}}, which returned the last byte of a file, {{tt|std::feof}} returns zero. The next {{lc|std::fgetc}} fails and changes the stream state to ''end-of-file''. Only then {{tt|std::feof}} returns non-zero.

In typical usage, input stream processing stops on any error; {{tt|feof}} and {{lc|std::ferror}} are then used to distinguish between different error conditions.
