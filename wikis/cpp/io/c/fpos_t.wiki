{{tt|std::fpos_t}} is a non-array complete object type, can be used to store (by {{lc|std::fgetpos}}) and restore (by {{lc|std::fsetpos}}) the position and multibyte parser state (if any) for a C stream.

The multibyte parser state of a wide-oriented C stream is represented by a {{lc|std::mbstate_t}} object, whose value is stored as part of the value of a {{tt|std::fpos_t}} object by {{lc|std::fgetpos}}.
