{{ddcl|header=cwchar|
std::wint_t ungetwc( std::wint_t ch, std::FILE* stream );
}}

If {{tt|ch}} does not equal {{lc|WEOF}}, pushes the wide character {{tt|ch}} into the input buffer associated with the stream {{tt|stream}} in such a manner than subsequent read operation from {{tt|stream}} will retrieve that wide character. The external device associated with the stream is not modified.

Stream repositioning operations {{lc|std::fseek}}, {{lc|std::fsetpos}}, and {{lc|std::rewind}} discard the effects of {{tt|std::ungetwc}}.

If {{tt|std::ungetwc}} is called more than once without an intervening read or repositioning, it may fail (in other words, a pushback buffer of size 1 is guaranteed, but any larger buffer is implementation-defined). If multiple successful {{tt|std::ungetwc}} were performed, read operations retrieve the pushed-back wide characters in reverse order of {{tt|std::ungetwc}}

If {{tt|ch}} equals {{lc|WEOF}}, the operation fails and the stream is not affected.

A successful call to {{tt|std::ungetwc}} clears the end of file status flag {{lc|feof}}.

A successful call to {{tt|std::ungetwc}} on a stream (whether text or binary) modifies the stream position indicator in unspecified manner but guarantees that after all pushed-back wide characters are retrieved with a read operation, the stream position indicator is equal to its value before {{tt|std::ungetwc}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|ch|wide character to be put back}}
{{par|stream|file stream to put the wide character back to}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
On success {{tt|ch}} is returned.

On failure {{lc|WEOF}} is returned and the given stream remains unchanged.
