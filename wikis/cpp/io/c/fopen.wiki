{{ddcl|header=cstdio|
std::FILE* fopen( const char* filename, const char* mode );
}}

Opens a file indicated by {{c|filename}} and returns a file stream associated with that file. {{c|mode}} is used to determine the file access mode. 

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|filename|file name to associate the file stream to}}
{{par|mode|null-terminated character string determining [[#File access flags|file access mode]]}}
{{par end}}

===File access flags===
{{cpp/io/c/file access flags}}

===Return value===
If successful, returns a pointer to the object that controls the opened file stream, with both eof and error bits cleared. The stream is fully buffered unless {{spar|filename}} refers to an interactive device.

On error, returns a null pointer. [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fopen.html POSIX requires] that {{lc|errno}} is set in this case.

===Notes===
The format of {{c|filename}} is implementation-defined, and does not necessarily refer to a file (e.g. it may be the console or another device accessible through filesystem API). On platforms that support them, {{c|filename}} may include absolute or relative filesystem path.

For portable directory and file naming, see [[cpp/filesystem|C++ filesystem library]] or [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm boost.filesystem].
