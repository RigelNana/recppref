class ostrstream : public std::ostream
}}

The class {{tt|ostrstream}} implements output operations on array-backed streams. It essentially wraps a raw array I/O device implementation ({{lc|std::strstreambuf}}) into the higher-level interface of {{lc|std::basic_ostream}}. 

The typical implementation of {{tt|ostrstream}} holds only one non-derived data member: an object of type {{lc|std::strstreambuf}}.

===Notes===
After any call to {{lc|str()}}, a call to {{lc|freeze()|freeze(false)}} is required to allow the destructor to deallocate the buffer as necessary.

Before any call to {{lc|str()}} that uses the result as a C-string, the buffer must be null-terminated, typically with {{lc|std::ends}}.

{{tt|ostrstream}} has been deprecated since C++98 and removed since C++26. {{lc|std::ostringstream}}{{rev inl|since=c++23|, {{ltt|cpp/io/basic_ospanstream|std::ospanstream}}}},  and [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/iostreams/doc/classes/array.html#array_sink {{tt|boost::iostreams::array_sink}}] are the recommended replacements.
