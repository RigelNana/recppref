Constructs a new {{tt|std::basic_ios}} object. 

@1@ Default constructor. The internal state is not initialized. {{lc|init()}} must be called before the first use of the object or before destructor, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

@2@ Initializes the internal state by calling {{c|init(sb)}}. The associated stream buffer is set to {{c|sb}}. 

@3@ The copy constructor is {{rev inl|until=c++11|declared private and not defined}}{{rev inl|since=c++11|explicitly defined as deleted}}: I/O streams are not {{named req|CopyConstructible}}.
