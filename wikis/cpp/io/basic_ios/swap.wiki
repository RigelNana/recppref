protected:
void swap( basic_ios&amp; other ) noexcept;
}}

Exchanges the states of {{c|*this}} and {{c|other}}, except for the associated {{tt|rdbuf}} objects. {{lc|rdbuf()}} and {{c|other.rdbuf()}} returns the same values as before the call.

This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap member functions of the derived stream classes such as {{lc|std::basic_ofstream}} or {{lc|std::basic_istringstream}}, which know how to correctly swap the associated stream buffers.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|other|the {{tt|basic_ios}} object to exchange the state with}}
{{par end}}
