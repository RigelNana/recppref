protected:
void set_rdbuf( std::basic_streambuf&lt;CharT,Traits&gt;* sb );
}}

Sets the associated stream buffer to {{tt|sb}} without clearing the error state.

This member function is protected: it is called by the move constructors of the derived streams such as {{lc|std::basic_ofstream}} or {{lc|std::basic_istringstream}}, as the final step after constructing the base class and after moving the stream buffer: only the most derived stream class knows how to correctly move the stream buffer, but {{lc|std::basic_ios}} needs to be made aware of the stream's new location so that its public member functions can access it.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | sb | stream buffer to associate to}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
(none)

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.

===Example===
