Replaces the current state with that of {{tt|other}}, except for the associated {{tt|rdbuf}}. {{tt|other}} is in valid, but unspecified state after the call. After the call to this function, {{lc|rdbuf()}} returns a null pointer, {{c|other.rdbuf()}} returns the same value as before the call, and {{c|other.tie()}} returns a null pointer.

This member function is protected: it is called by the protected move constructors of the derived stream classes {{lc|std::basic_ostream}} and {{lc|std::basic_istream}}, which, in turn, are called by the public move constructors of the further derived stream classes such as {{lc|std::basic_ofstream}}, which know how to correctly move the associated streambuffer.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | other | the {{tt|basic_ios}} object to transfer the state from}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
(none)
