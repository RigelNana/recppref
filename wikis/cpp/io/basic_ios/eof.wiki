Returns {{c|true}} if the associated stream has reached end-of-file. Specifically, returns {{c|true}} if {{tt|eofbit}} is set in {{lc|rdstate()}}.

See {{l2tt|cpp/io/ios_base/iostate}} for the list of conditions that set {{tt|eofbit}}.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
{{c|true}} if an end-of-file has occurred, {{c|false}} otherwise.

===Notes===
This function only reports the stream state as set by the most recent I/O operation; it does not examine the associated data source. For example, if the most recent I/O was a {{ltt|cpp/io/basic_istream/get|get()}} which returned the last byte of a file, {{tt|eof()}} returns {{c|false}}. The next {{tt|get()}} fails to read anything and sets the {{tt|eofbit}}. Only then does {{tt|eof()}} return {{c|true}}.

In typical usage, input stream processing stops on any error. {{tt|eof()}} and {{lc|fail()}} can then be used to distinguish between different error conditions.
