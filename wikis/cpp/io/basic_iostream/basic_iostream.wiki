Constructs new stream object.

@1@ Initializes with streambuf {{c|sb}}. The base classes are initialized as {{c|basic_istream&lt;CharT,Traits&gt;(sb)}} and {{c|basic_ostream&lt;CharT,Traits&gt;(sb)}}. After the call {{c|1=rdbuf() == sb}} and {{c|1=gcount() == 0}}.

@2@ Copy construction is not allowed.

@3@ Move constructor: move-constructs the first base class {{tt|basic_istream}} as {{c|basic_istream&lt;CharT,Traits&gt;(std::move(rhs));}}, which in turn move-constructs and initializes the virtual base {{lc|std::basic_ios}}. The initialization of the other base, {{tt|basic_ostream}}, is implementation-defined (e.g., a protected default constructor may be added to {{lc|std::basic_ostream}}, which does nothing) because move-construction cannot use {{tt|rhs}} twice. This move constructor is protected: it is called by the move constructors of the derived stream classes {{lc|std::basic_fstream}} and {{lc|std::basic_stringstream}} before they move-construct and associate the stream buffer.

===Parameters===
