virtual ~basic_iostream();

Destructs the input/output stream.

===Notes===
This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying stream buffer ({{tt|rdbuf()}}): the destructors of the derived streams such as {{lc|std::basic_fstream}} and {{lc|std::basic_stringstream}} are responsible for calling the destructors of the stream buffers.
