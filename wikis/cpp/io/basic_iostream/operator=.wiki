Assigns another stream object.

@1@ Copy assignment is not allowed.
@2@ Move assigns another stream object. Effectively calls {{c|swap(rhs)}}. This move assignment operator is protected: it is called by the move assignment operators of the derived stream classes {{lc|std::basic_stringstream}} and {{lc|std::basic_fstream}} which know how to properly move-assign the associated stream buffers.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | other | another stream to assign state of}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|*this}}
