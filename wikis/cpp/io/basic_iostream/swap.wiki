protected:
void swap( basic_iostream&amp; other );
}}

Exchanges the state with another input/output stream object. Effectively calls {{c|basic_istream&lt;CharT,Traits&gt;::swap(other)}}.

This member function is protected: it is called by the swap member functions of the derived stream classes {{lc|std::basic_stringstream}} and {{lc|std::basic_fstream}}, which know how to correctly swap the associated stream buffers.


===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | other | another stream to exchange the state with}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|*this}}
