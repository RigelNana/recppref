@1@ The copy assignment operator is protected, and is deleted. Input streams are not CopyAssignable.

@2@ The move assignment operator exchanges the {{rlpf|gcount}} values and all data members of the base class, except for {{ltf|cpp/io/basic_ios/rdbuf}}, with {{c|rhs}}, as if by calling {{c|swap(*rhs)}}. This move assignment operator is protected: it is only called by the move assignment operators of the derived movable input stream classes {{lc|std::basic_ifstream}} and {{lc|std::basic_istringstream}}, which know how to correctly move-assign the associated streambuffers.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|rhs|the basic_istream object from which to assign to {{c|*this}}}}
{{par end}}

===Example===
{{example
|code=
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s1;
    s1 = std::istringstream("test"); // OK

//  std::cin = std::istringstream("test"); // ERROR: 'operator=' is protected
}
}}
