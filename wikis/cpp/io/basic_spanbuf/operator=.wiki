@1@ Move assignment operator. Equivalent to {{c|auto tmp{std::move(rhs)}; this-&gt;swap(tmp); return *this;}}. After move assignment, {{c|*this}} holds the state {{c|rhs}} held before move assignment. It is implementation-defined whether {{c|rhs}} still hold the underlying buffer after move assignment.

@2@ The copy assignment operator is deleted; {{tt|basic_spanbuf}} is not {{named req|CopyAssignable}}.
