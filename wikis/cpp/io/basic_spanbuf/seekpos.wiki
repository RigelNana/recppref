pos_type seekpos( pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which =
                      std::ios_base::in {{!}} std::ios_base::out ) override;
}}

Repositions the next pointer to the get and/or put area, if possible, to the position indicated by {{tt|sp}}.

Equivalent to {{c|return seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which);}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | sp | stream position, such as one obtained by {{lc|seekoff()}} or {{tt|seekpos()}}}}
{{par | which | defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or both are affected. It can be one or a combination of the following constants:
{{cpp/io/ios_base/openmode streambuf consts}} }}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{tt|sp}} on success or {{c|pos_type(off_type(-1))}} on failure.

===Notes===
{{tt|seekpos()}} is called by {{lc|std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos()}}, which is called by the single-argument versions of {{lc|std::basic_istream::seekg()}} and {{lc|std::basic_ostream::seekp()}}.

===Example===
