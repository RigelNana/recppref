Creates and returns a {{lc|std::basic_string_view}} over the underlying character sequence. 
* For input-only streams, the returned view represents the range {{c|[eback(), egptr())}}.
* For input/output or output-only streams, references the characters from {{c|pbase()}} to the last character in the sequence regardless of {{c|egptr()}} and {{c|epptr()}}.
* If the stream is neither input nor output, returns {{c|std::basic_string_view&lt;CharT, Traits&gt;{} }}.

The member character sequence in a buffer open for writing can be over-allocated for efficiency purposes. In that case, only the ''initialized characters'' are referenced: these characters are the ones that were obtained from the string argument of the constructor, the string argument used by the most recent call to a setter overload of {{tt|str()}}, or from a write operation. A typical implementation that uses over-allocation maintains a high-watermark pointer to track the end of the initialized part of the buffer and the returned view references the characters from {{c|pbase()}} to the high-watermark pointer.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
A view over the underlying character sequence.

===Notes===
Using of the return value is undefined behavior if the underlying character sequence is destroyed or invalidated, unless the return value is empty.

This function is typically accessed through {{lc|std::basic_istringstream::view()}}, {{lc|std::basic_ostringstream::view()}}, or {{lc|std::basic_stringstream::view()}}.
