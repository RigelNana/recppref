virtual ~ios_base();
}}

Destroys the {{tt|ios_base}} object. 

Before any of the member functions would yield undefined results, calls callbacks, registered by {{ltf|cpp/io/ios_base/register_callback}} passing {{ltt|cpp/io/ios_base/event | erase_event}} as parameter. Then, deallocates any memory obtained.

No operations on {{tt|rdbuf}} are performed, it is not destroyed.
