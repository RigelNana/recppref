class Init;
}}

This class is used to ensure that the default C++ streams ({{lc|std::cin}}, {{lc|std::cout}}, etc.) are properly initialized and destructed. The class tracks how many instances of it are created and initializes the C++ streams when the first instance is constructed as well as flushes the output streams when the last instance is destructed.

The header {{header|iostream}} behaves as if it defines (directly or indirectly) an instance of {{tt|std::ios_base::Init}} with static storage duration: this makes it safe to access the standard I/O streams in the constructors and destructors of static objects with [[cpp/language/initialization#Dynamic initialization|ordered initialization]] (as long as {{header|iostream}} is included in the translation unit before these objects were defined).

{{rrev|since=c++23|
Each [[cpp/standard library#Importing modules|C++ library module]] in a [[cpp/freestanding|hosted implementation]] behaves as if it contains an [[cpp/language/modules#Module declarations|interface unit]] that defines an [[cpp/language/modules#Exporting declarations and definitions|unexported]] {{tt|std::ios_base::Init}} variable with
[[cpp/language/initialization#Dynamic initialization|ordered initialization]].

As a result, the definition of that variable is appearance-ordered before any declaration following the point of importation of a C++ library module. Whether such a definition exists is unobservable by a program that does not reference any of the standard iostream objects.
