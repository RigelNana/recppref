@1@ The copy constructor is {{rev inl|until=c++11|private}}{{rev inl|since=c++11|deleted}}: streams are not copyable.

@2@ The default constructor is protected: only derived classes may construct {{tt|std::ios_base}}. The internal state is undefined after the construction. The derived class must call {{l2tf std|cpp/io/basic_ios/init}} to complete initialization before first use or before destructor; otherwise the behavior is undefined.

===Notes===
The same applies to the constructors of the next class in the I/O hierarchy, {{lc|std::basic_ios}}. Further-derived classes ({{lc|std::istream}} and {{lc|std::ostream}}) are always constructed with a concrete stream buffer object and call {{l2tf std|cpp/io/basic_ios/init}}, possibly more than once, to complete initialization of their virtual base.
