typedef void ( *event_callback )( event type, ios_base&amp; ios, int index );
}}

The type of function callbacks that can be registered using {{lc|register_callback()}} to be called on specific events.

{{c|type}} is a value of type {{l2tt|cpp/io/ios_base/event}} which indicates the type of the event that will invoke this callback.

{{c|ios}} refers to the stream object for which the callback is invoked: {{c|*this}} is passed as the argument when callbacks are invoked by {{lc|std::ios_base}} and {{lc|std::basic_ios}} member functions.

{{c|index}} is the user-provided value passed to {{lc|register_callback()}} when registering the function.
