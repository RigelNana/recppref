The type {{tt|std::streamoff}} is an implementation-defined {{rev inl|since=c++11|signed integral}} type of sufficient size to represent the maximum possible file size supported by the operating system. {{rev inl|since=c++11|Typically, this is an alias for {{c|long long}}.}}

It is used to represent offsets from stream positions (values of type {{lc|std::fpos}}). A {{tt|std::streamoff}} value constructed from {{c|-1}} is also used to represent error conditions by some of the I/O library functions.

===Relationship with std::fpos===
* the difference between two {{lc|std::fpos}} objects is a value of type {{tt|std::streamoff}}

* a value of type {{tt|std::streamoff}} may be added or subtracted from {{lc|std::fpos}} yielding a different {{lc|std::fpos}}.

* a value of type {{lc|std::fpos}} is implicitly convertible to {{tt|std::streamoff}} (the conversion result is the offset from the beginning of the file).

* a value of type {{lc|std::fpos}} is constructible from a value of type {{tt|std::streamoff}}
