Estimates the number of characters available for input in the associated character sequence. {{lc|underflow()}} is guaranteed not to return {{c|Traits::eof()}} or throw an exception until at least that many characters are extracted.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
The number of characters that are certainly available in the associated character sequence, or {{c|-1}} if {{tt|showmanyc}} can determine, without blocking, that no characters are available. If {{tt|showmanyc}} returns {{c|-1}}, {{lc|underflow()}} and {{lc|uflow()}} will definitely return {{c|Traits::eof}} or throw.

The base class version returns {{c|0}}, which has the meaning of "unsure if there are characters available in the associated sequence".

===Notes===
The name of this function stands for "stream: how many characters?", so it is pronounced "S how many C", rather than "show many C".
