{{dcl begin}}
{{dcl|num=1|

basic_streambuf();

{{dcl|num=2|since=c++11|
protected:
basic_streambuf(const basic_streambuf&amp; rhs);

{{dcl end}}

@1@ Constructs the {{tt|basic_streambuf}} object, initializes the six pointer members ({{tt|eback()}}, {{tt|gptr()}}, {{tt|egptr()}}, {{tt|pbase()}}, {{tt|pptr()}}, and {{tt|epptr()}}) to null pointer values, and the locale member to {{c|std::locale()}}, a copy of the global C++ locale at the time of construction.
@2@ Constructs a copy of {{c|rhs}}, initializing the six pointers and the locale object with the copies of the values held by {{c|rhs}}. Note that this is a shallow copy: the pointers of the newly-constructed basic_streambuf are pointing into the same character array as the pointers of {{c|rhs}}.

Both constructors are protected, and are only called by the concrete streambuf classes, such as {{lc|std::basic_filebuf}}, {{lc|std::basic_stringbuf}}, or {{lc|std::strstreambuf}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|rhs|a streambuf object to copy}}
{{par end}}

===Notes===
Until C++11, it was unspecified whether {{tt|basic_streambuf}} or any of its derived classes is {{named req|CopyConstructible}} ({{lwg|421}}), and different C++ library implementations provided different options.

===Example===
