{{dcl begin}}
{{dcl|1=
virtual ~basic_streambuf();
}}
{{dcl end}}

This destructor has no effect: the members of this {{tt|basic_streambuf}} (the pointers and the locale) are destructed in accordance with the usual object destruction sequence after this destructor returns. However, since it is declared public virtual, it allows the objects that are derived from {{tt|std::basic_streambuf}} to be deleted through a pointer to base class.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Example===
{{example
|code=
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::filebuf* fbp = new std::filebuf;
    fbp-&gt;open("test.txt", std::ios_base::out);
    fbp-&gt;sputn("Hello\n", 6);
    
    std::streambuf* sbp = fbp;
    delete sbp; // the file is closed, output flushed and written
    
    std::ifstream f("test.txt");
    std::cout &lt;&lt; f.rdbuf(); // proof
}
|output=
Hello
}}
