std::streamsize sputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );

@1@ Calls {{c|xsputn(s, count)}} of the most derived class.

@2@ Writes {{c|count}} characters to the output sequence from the character array whose first element is pointed to by {{c|s}}. The characters are written as if by repeated calls to {{lc|sputc()}}. Writing stops when either {{c|count}} characters are written or a call to {{lc|sputc()}} would have returned {{c|Traits::eof()}}.

If the put area becomes full ({{c|1=pptr() == epptr()}}), it is unspecified whether {{lc|overflow()}} is actually called or its effect is achieved by other means. 

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
The number of characters successfully written.

===Notes===
"achieved by other means" permits bulk I/O without intermediate buffering: that is how {{lc|std::ofstream::write()}} simply passes the pointer to the suitable system call in some implementations.

===Example===
{{example|
|code=
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s1;
    std::streamsize sz = s1.rdbuf()-&gt;sputn("This is a test", 14);
    s1 &lt;&lt; '\n';
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "The call to sputn() returned " &lt;&lt; sz &lt;&lt; '\n'
              &lt;&lt; "The output sequence contains " &lt;&lt; s1.str();
    
    std::istringstream s2;
    sz = s2.rdbuf()-&gt;sputn("This is a test", 14);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "The call to sputn() on an input stream returned " &lt;&lt; sz &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
|output=
The call to sputn() returned 14
The output sequence contains This is a test
The call to sputn() on an input stream returned 0
