{{ddcl | 1=
int_type snextc();
}}

Advances the input sequence by one character and reads one character.

The function calls {{lc|sbumpc()}} to advance the input sequence. If that function returns {{c|Traits::eof()}} meaning that input sequence has been exhausted and {{lc|uflow()}} could not retrieve more data, {{c|Traits::eof()}} is returned. Otherwise {{lc|sgetc()}} is called in order to read the character.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
The value of the next character. If the input sequence has been exhausted, {{c|Traits::eof()}} is returned.

===Example===
{{example|
