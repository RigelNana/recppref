@1@ Calls {{tt|xsgetn(s, count)}} of the most derived class.

@2@ Reads {{tt|count}} characters from the input sequence and stores them into a character array pointed to by {{tt|s}}. The characters are read as if by repeated calls to {{lc|sbumpc()}}. That is, if less than {{tt|count}} characters are immediately available, the function calls {{lc|uflow()}} to provide more until {{c|Traits::eof()}} is returned.
@@Classes derived from {{tt|std::basic_streambuf}} are permitted to provide more efficient implementations of this function.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par | s | pointer to the beginning of a char_type array}}
{{par | count | maximum number of characters to read.}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
The number of characters successfully read. If it is less than {{tt|count}} the input sequence has reached the end.

===Notes===
The rule about "more efficient implementations" permits bulk I/O without intermediate buffering: that's how {{lc|std::ifstream::read}} simply passes the pointer to the POSIX {{tt|read()}} system call in some implementations of iostreams

===Example===
