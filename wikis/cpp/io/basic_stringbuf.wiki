{{tt|std::basic_stringbuf}} is a {{lc|std::basic_streambuf}} whose associated character sequence is a memory-resident sequence of arbitrary characters, which can be initialized from or made available as an instance of {{lc|std::basic_string}}.

Typical implementations of {{tt|std::basic_stringbuf}} hold an object of type {{lc|std::basic_string}} or equivalent resizable sequence container directly as a data member and use it as both the controlled character sequence (the array where the six pointers of {{lc|std::basic_streambuf}} are pointing to) and as the associated character sequence (the source of characters for all input operations and the target for the output).

In addition, a typical implementation holds a data member of type {{lc|std::ios_base::openmode}} to indicate the I/O mode of the associated stream (input-only, output-only, input/output, at-end, etc).
{{rrev|since=c++11|If over-allocation strategy is used by {{lc|overflow()}}, an additional high-watermark pointer may be stored to track the last initialized character.}}
