static constexpr void shrink_to_fit() noexcept;
}}

Does nothing.

Nominally, this function is a non-binding request to decrease capacity so that the internal storage contains only {{lc|size()}} elements. However, such a request is always ignored by the fixed-capacity container {{c/core|std::inplace_vector&lt;T, N&gt;}}.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
(none)

===Complexity===
Constant.

===Notes===
This function exists for compatibility with vector-like interfaces.
