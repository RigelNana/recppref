@1@ Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function {{tt|do_close}} of the most derived class.

@2@ Releases the implementation-defined resources associated with an open catalog that is designated by the value {{c|c}} of type {{tt|catalog}} (inherited from {{lc|std::messages_base}}), which was obtained from {{lc|open()}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|c|a valid open catalog identifier, on which {{tt|close()}} has not yet been called}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
(none)

===Notes===
On POSIX systems, this function call usually translates to a call to {{tt|[https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/catclose.html catclose()]}}. In GNU libstdc++, which is implemented in terms of GNU {{tt|gettext()}}, it does nothing.
