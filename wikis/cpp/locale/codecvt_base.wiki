===Member types===
{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc hitem | Member type | Definition}}
{{dsc | {{c|enum result { ok, partial, error, noconv };}} | Unscoped enumeration type}}
{{dsc end}}

{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc hitem | Value | Explanation}}
{{dsc | {{tt|ok}}      | conversion was completed with no error}}
{{dsc | {{tt|partial}} | not all source characters were converted}}
{{dsc | {{tt|error}}   | encountered an invalid character}}
{{dsc | {{tt|noconv}}  | no conversion required, input and output types are the same}}
{{dsc end}}

===Notes===
The value {{lc|std::codecvt_base::partial}} is used to indicate that either the destination range is too short to receive the results of the conversion or the input is truncated in the middle of an otherwise valid multibyte character.
