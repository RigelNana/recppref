Destructs a {{c|std::ctype&lt;char&gt;}} facet. This destructor is protected and virtual (due to [[cpp/locale/locale/facet|base class]] destructor being virtual). An object of type {{c|std::ctype&lt;char&gt;}}, like most facets, can only be destroyed when the last {{lc|std::locale}} object that implements this facet goes out of scope or if a user-defined class is derived from {{c|std::ctype&lt;char&gt;}} and implements a public destructor.

If, when this instance of {{c|std::ctype&lt;char&gt;}} was constructed, a custom classification table was provided and the second argument to the constructor (the boolean {{tt|del}}) was {{c|true}}, then this destructor executes {{c|delete[] table()}}.
