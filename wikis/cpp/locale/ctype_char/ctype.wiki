{{dcl end}}

Creates a {{c|std::ctype&lt;char&gt;}} facet and forwards the starting reference count {{c|refs}} to the base class constructor, {{ltt|cpp/locale/locale/facet/facet|locale::facet::facet()}}.

If {{c|tbl}} is null, {{lc|classic_table()}} is used by all classification member functions. Otherwise, {{c|tbl}} must be a pointer to the first element of an array of masks, at least {{c|std::ctype&lt;char&gt;::table_size}} in size, and that array is used by all of this facet's classification member functions.

If {{c|del}} is {{c|true}}, it is assumed that the array was allocated with {{c|new[]}}, and the destructor of this facet will call {{c|delete[] tbl}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|tbl|classification table to use or a null pointer}}
{{par|del|indicator whether the table needs to be deleted}}
{{par|refs|starting reference count}}
{{par end}}

===Example===
