@1@ Creates a facet with starting reference count {{c|refs}}. If {{c|refs}} is non-zero, the facet will not be deleted when the last locale referencing it goes out of scope. A facet with static or dynamic storage duration should always be constructed with a non-zero {{c|refs}}.

@2@ Copy constructor is deleted; {{lc|std::locale::facet}} is not copyable.
