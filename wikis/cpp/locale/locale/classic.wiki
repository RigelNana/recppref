{{ddcl|
static const locale&amp; classic();
}}

Obtains a reference to the C++ locale that implements the classic {{c|"C"}} locale semantics. This locale, unlike the global locale, cannot be altered. 

===Parameters===
none

===Return value===
Returns a reference to the {{c|"C"}} locale.

===Notes===
Some of the standard-required facets, such as the UTF-8/UTF-32 conversion facet {{c|std::codecvt&lt;char32_t, char, std::mbstate_t&gt;}}, have no equivalents in the {{c|"C"}} locale, but they are nevertheless present in the locale returned by {{c|std::locale::classic()}}, as in any other locale constructed in a C++ program.

===Example===
