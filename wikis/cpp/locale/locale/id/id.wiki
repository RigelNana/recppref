@1@ Default constructor: creates an object of type {{lc|std::locale::id}} with implementation-specific content.

@2@ Copy constructor is deleted; {{lc|std::locale::id}} is not copyable.

===Notes===
Because locales and facets must be available for the IO stream objects with static storage duration, such as {{lc|std::cout}}, typical implementations let implicit default constructor zero-initialize the contents of {{lc|std::locale::id}} during static initialization (before constructors run for static objects), and when a facet is added to any locale for the first time, the locale completes initialization of the facet's {{c|id}}.
