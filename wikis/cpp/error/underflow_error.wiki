class underflow_error;
}}

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It may be used to report arithmetic underflow errors (that is, situations where the result of a computation is a subnormal floating-point value).

The standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report underflow errors as specified in {{lc|math_errhandling}}). Third-party libraries, however, use this. For example, [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/error_handling.html boost.math] throws {{tt|std::underflow_error}} if {{tt|boost::math::policies::throw_on_error}} is enabled (the default setting).
