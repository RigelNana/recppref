class range_error;
}}

Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It can be used to report range errors (that is, situations where a result of a computation cannot be represented by the destination type).

The only standard library components that throw this exception are {{lc|std::wstring_convert::from_bytes}} and {{lc|std::wstring_convert::to_bytes}}.

The mathematical functions in the standard library components do not throw this exception (mathematical functions report range errors as specified in {{lc|math_errhandling}}).
