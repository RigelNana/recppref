{{tt|noop_coroutine_promise}} is the promise type of no-op coroutines.

A no-op coroutine behaves as if it
* does nothing other than the control flow of a coroutine, and
* is suspended immediately after beginning and resumption, and
* has a coroutine state such that destroying the state is no-op, and
* never reaches its final suspended point if there is any {{lc|std::coroutine_handle}} referring to it.

{{todo|more precise wording}}

No-op coroutines can be started by {{lc|std::noop_coroutine}}, and controlled by the coroutine handle it returns. The returned coroutine handle is of type {{lc|std::noop_coroutine_handle}}, which is a synonym for {{c|std::coroutine_handle&lt;std::noop_coroutine_promise&gt;}}.

Some operations of a no-op coroutines are determined no-op at compile time through the type {{tt|std::noop_coroutine_handle}}.
