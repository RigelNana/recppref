Replaces the underlying address.

@1@ Replaces the underlying address with a null pointer value. After assignment, {{c|*this}} does not refer to a coroutine. This assignment operator is not declared for specialization {{c|std::coroutine_handle&lt;std::noop_coroutine_promise&gt;}}.

@2,3@ Replaces the underlying address with the one of {{c|other}}. Copy and move assignment operators are equivalent to implicitly declared ones.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|other|another {{tt|coroutine_handle}} to assign from}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
{{c|*this}}
