Obtains a reference to the promise object.

The behavior is undefined if {{c|*this}} does not refer to a coroutine whose promise object has not been destroyed.

This function is not provided for the specialization {{c|std::coroutine_handle&lt;&gt;}}.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
A reference to the promise object.

===Notes===
The promise object of a no-op coroutine is not destroyed as long as there is some {{lc|std::noop_coroutine_handle}} referring to the coroutine.
