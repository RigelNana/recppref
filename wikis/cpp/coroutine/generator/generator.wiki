Constructs a {{tt|generator}}.

@1@ The copy-constructor is deleted.

@2@ The move-constructor that initializes the underlying {{rlpt|/#Data members|''coroutine_''}} with {{c|std::exchange(other.coroutine_, {})}}, and the underlying stack of coroutine handles ({{rlpt|/#Data members|''active_''}}) with {{c|std::exchange(other.active_, nullptr)}}.
Note, that the iterators, previously obtained from {{c|other}}, are not invalidated, but become iterators into {{c|*this}}.

===Parameters===

{{par|other|a generator object to be moved in}}
