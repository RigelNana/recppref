{{cpp/coroutine/generator/title|begin}}
{{cpp/coroutine/generator/navbar}}
{{ddcl|since=c++23|1=
/*iterator*/ begin();
}}

Pushes {{rlpi|/#Data members|coroutine_}} into {{box|{{co|*}}{{rlpi|/#Data members|active_}}}} stack, then evaluates {{c|coroutine_.resume()}}.

Before invocation of {{tt|begin()}} the {{rlpi|/#Data members|coroutine_}} must refer to a coroutine suspended at its {{lt|cpp/language/coroutines#co await|initial suspend point}}.

===Return value===
An iterator whose {{tti|coroutine_}} member refers to the same coroutine as {{rlpi|/#Data members|coroutine_}} does.

===Notes===
It is an undefined behavior to call {{tt|begin()}} more than once on the same {{rlpt|/|generator}} object.

===Example===
