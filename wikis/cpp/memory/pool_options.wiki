===Data members===

{{dsc hitem | Member | Meaning }}
{{dsc | {{ddcl|std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk;}} | The maximum number of blocks that will be allocated at once from the upstream {{lc|std::pmr::memory_resource}} to replenish the pool. If the value of {{tt|max_blocks_per_chunk}} is zero or is greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may choose to use a smaller value than is specified in this field and may use different values for different pools. }}
{{dsc | {{ddcl|std::size_t largest_required_pool_block;}}|The largest allocation size that is required to be fulfilled using the pooling mechanism. Attempts to allocate a single block larger than this threshold will be allocated directly from the upstream {{lc|std::pmr::memory_resource}}. If {{tt|largest_required_pool_block}} is zero or is greater than an implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The implementation may choose a pass-through threshold larger than specified in this field.
