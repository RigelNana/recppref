virtual void* do_allocate( std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment );
}}

Allocates storage. 

If the pool selected for a block of size {{c|bytes}} is unable to satisfy the request from its internal data structures, calls {{tt|allocate()}} on the upstream memory resource to obtain memory.

If the size requested is larger than what the largest pool can handle, memory is allocated by calling {{tt|allocate()}} on the upstream memory resource.

===Return value===
A pointer to allocated storage of at least {{c|bytes}} bytes in size, aligned to the specified {{c|alignment}} if such alignment is supported, and to {{c|alignof(std::max_align_t)}} otherwise. 

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing unless calling {{tt|allocate()}} on the upstream memory resource throws.
