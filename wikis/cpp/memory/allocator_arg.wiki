@1@ {{tt|std::allocator_arg_t}} is an empty class type used to disambiguate the overloads of constructors and member functions of allocator-aware objects, including {{lc|std::tuple}}{{rev inl|until=c++17|, {{lc|std::function}}, {{lc|std::packaged_task}},}} and {{lc|std::promise}}.

@2@ {{tt|std::allocator_arg}} is an instance of {{vl|1}} that can be passed to the constructors and member functions of such permitted types.
