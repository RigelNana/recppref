Releases all allocated memory by calling the {{tt|deallocate}} function on the upstream memory resource as necessary. Resets ''current buffer'' and ''next buffer size'' to their initial values at construction.

Memory is released back to the upstream resource even if {{tt|deallocate}} has not been called for some of the allocated blocks.
