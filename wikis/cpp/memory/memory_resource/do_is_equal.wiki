virtual bool do_is_equal( const std::pmr::memory_resource&amp; other ) const noexcept = 0;
}}

Compares {{c|*this}} for equality with {{c|other}}.

Two {{tt|memory_resource}}s compare equal if and only if memory allocated from one {{tt|memory_resource}} can be deallocated from the other and vice versa.

=== Notes ===
The most-derived type of {{c|other}} may not match the most derived type of {{c|*this}}. A derived class implementation therefore must typically check whether the most derived types of {{c|*this}} and {{c|other}} match using {{ltt|cpp/language/dynamic_cast|dynamic_cast}}, and immediately return {{c|false}} if the cast fails.
