virtual void do_deallocate( void* p, std::size_t bytes, std::size_t alignment ) = 0;
}}

Deallocates the storage pointed to by {{c|p}}.

{{c|p}} must have been returned by a prior call to {{tt|allocate(bytes, alignment)}} on a {{tt|memory_resource}} that compares equal to {{c|*this}}, and the storage it points to must not yet have been deallocated, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

Throws nothing.
