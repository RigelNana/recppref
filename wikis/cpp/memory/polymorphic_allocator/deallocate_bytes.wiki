{{ddcl|since=c++20|1= 
void deallocate_bytes( void* p,
                       std::size_t nbytes,
                       std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );
}}

Deallocates the storage pointed to by {{c|p}}, which must have been allocated from a {{lc|std::pmr::memory_resource}} {{c|x}} that compares equal to {{c|*resource()}}, using {{c|x.allocate(nbytes, alignment)}}, typically through a call to {{c|allocate_bytes(nbytes, alignment)}}.

Equivalent to {{c|resource()-&gt;deallocate(p, nbytes, alignment);}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|p|pointer to memory to deallocate}}
{{par|nbytes|the number of bytes originally allocated}}
{{par|alignment|the alignment originally allocated}}
{{par end}}

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.

===Notes===
This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator {{c|std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;}}, but it may be useful in any specialization.
