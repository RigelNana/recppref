{{ddcl|since=c++20|1= 
template&lt; class U &gt;
void deallocate_object( U* p, std::size_t n = 1 );
}}

Deallocates the storage pointed to by {{c|p}}, which must have been allocated from a {{lc|std::pmr::memory_resource}} {{c|x}} that compares equal to {{c|*resource()}}, using {{c|x.allocate(n * sizeof(U), alignof(U))}}, typically through a call to {{c|allocate_object&lt;U&gt;(n)}}.

Equivalent to {{c|deallocate_bytes(p, n * sizeof(U), alignof(U));}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|p|pointer to memory to deallocate}}
{{par|n|number of objects of type U the memory was for}}
{{par end}}

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.

===Notes===
This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator {{c|std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;}}, but it may be useful in any specialization.
