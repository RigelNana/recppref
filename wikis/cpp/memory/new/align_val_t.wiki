Both [[cpp/language/new|new-expression]] and [[cpp/language/delete|delete-expression]], when used with objects whose alignment requirement is greater than {{tt|__STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT__}}, pass that alignment requirement as an argument of type {{tt|std::align_val_t}} to the selected allocation/deallocation function.

===Notes===
Alignment (as obtained by {{c|alignof}}) has the type {{lc|std::size_t}}, but placement forms of allocation and deallocation functions that take {{lc|std::size_t}} as an additional parameter are already in use, so this type is used instead.
