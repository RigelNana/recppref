template&lt; class T &gt;
T* undeclare_reachable( T* p );
}}

Removes the reachable status of the object, referenced by the pointer {{c|p}}, if it was previously set by {{lc|std::declare_reachable}}. If the object was declared reachable multiple times, equal number of calls to {{tt|undeclare_reachable}} would be needed to remove this status. Once the object is not declared reachable and has no pointers referencing it, it may be reclaimed by garbage collector or reported as a leak by a leak detector.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|p|a pointer to an object previously declared reachable and not destructed since then}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
A safely-derived copy of {{c|p}}.

===Exceptions===
Throws nothing.
