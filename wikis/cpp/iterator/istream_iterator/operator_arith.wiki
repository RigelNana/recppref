Reads a value from the underlying stream (using its {{ltt|cpp/io/basic_istream/operator gtgt|operator&gt;&gt;}}) and stores it into the iterator object. If the read fails (the underlying stream's {{ltf|cpp/io/basic_ios/fail}} returns {{c|true}}), the iterator becomes the end-of-stream iterator.

The behavior is undefined if the iterator is end-of-stream iterator.

===Parameters===
(none)

===Return value===
@1@ {{c|*this}}

@2@ An {{tt|istream_iterator}} that holds an unchanged value.
