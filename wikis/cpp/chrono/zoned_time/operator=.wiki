Assign the value of {{c|other}} to {{c|*this}}.

@1@ Defaulted copy assignment operator. Copy-assigns both the stored time point and the stored time zone pointer. {{tt|zoned_time}} has no move assignment operator; a move is a copy.
@2@ Assigns {{c|other}} to the stored time point. The time zone pointer is unchanged. After this call, {{c|1=get_sys_time() == other}}.
@3@ Converts {{c|other}} to a {{lc|std::chrono::sys_time}} as if by {{c|zone-&gt;to_sys(other)}} (where {{tt|zone}} is the non-static data member holding the stored time zone pointer) and assigns the result to the stored time point. The time zone pointer is unchanged. After this call, {{c|1=get_local_time() == other}}.

=== Return value ===
{{c|*this}}
