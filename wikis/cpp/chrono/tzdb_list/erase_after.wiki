{{dcl|since=c++20|1=
const_iterator erase_after( const_iterator p );
}}
{{dcl end}}

Erases the {{lc|std::chrono::tzdb}} referred to by the iterator following {{c|p}}. The behavior is undefined if that iterator is not dereferenceable. No pointers, references, or iterators are invalidated except for those referring to the erased element.

===Return value===
An iterator pointing to the element following the erased element, or {{lc|end()}} if no such element exists.

===Notes===
{{tt|tzdb_list}} is intended to be implementable as a singly linked list, and its interface resembles that of {{lc|std::forward_list}}. It has no {{tt|before_begin()}}, however, and so it is not possible to erase the first element.
