struct sys_info;
}}

The class {{tt|sys_info}} describes time zone information associated with a time zone at a particular point in time (represented as either a {{lc|std::chrono::sys_time}} or a {{lc|std::chrono::local_time}}). This is a low-level data structure typically not used directly by user code.

===Member objects===
{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc hitem|Member object|Type}}
{{dsc|{{tt|begin}}, {{tt|end}}|{{lc|std::chrono::sys_seconds}}}}
{{dsc|{{tt|offset}}|{{lc|std::chrono::seconds}}}}
{{dsc|{{tt|save}}|{{lc|std::chrono::minutes}}}}
{{dsc|{{tt|abbrev}}|{{lc|std::string}}}}
{{dsc end}}

The {{tt|begin}} and {{tt|end}} data members indicate the range - {{range plain|begin|end}} - in which the {{tt|offset}} and {{tt|abbrev}} are in effect for the time zone associated with this {{tt|sys_info}}.

The {{tt|offset}} and {{tt|abbrev}} data member indicate the UTC offset and time zone abbreviation, respectively, in effect for the associated time zone and {{lc|std::chrono::time_point}}. Note that time zone abbreviations are not unique.

The {{tt|save}} data member, if nonzero, indicates that the time zone is on daylight saving time at the specified time point. In this case, {{c|offset - save}} is a suggestion of what offset this time zone might use if it were off daylight saving time. However, this information is not authoritative: the only way to ascertain the actual offset is to query the time zone with a time point that is actually off daylight savings time (i.e. returns a {{tt|sys_info}} such that {{c|1=save == 0min}}).
