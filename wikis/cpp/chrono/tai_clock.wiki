The clock {{tt|std::chrono::tai_clock}} is a {{named req|Clock}} that represents {{enwiki|International Atomic Time}} (TAI). It measures time since 00:00:00, 1 January 1958, and is offset 10 seconds ahead of UTC at that date (i.e., its epoch, 1958-01-01 00:00:00 TAI, is 1957-12-31 23:59:50 UTC).

Leap seconds are not inserted into TAI. Thus, every time a leap second is inserted into UTC, UTC falls another second behind TAI. As of December 2017, UTC is 37 seconds behind TAI, reflecting the 10-second initial offset and the 27 leap seconds inserted between 1958 and 2017. Thus, 2018-01-01 00:00:00 UTC is equivalent to 2018-01-01 00:00:37 TAI.

{{tt|tai_clock}} meets the {{named req|Clock}} requirements. It does not meet the {{named req|TrivialClock}} requirements unless the implementation can guarantee that {{ltf|cpp/chrono/tai_clock/now}} does not throw an exception.
