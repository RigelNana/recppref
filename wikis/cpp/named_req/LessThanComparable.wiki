{{cpp/named req/title|LessThanComparable}}
{{cpp/named req/navbar}}
The type must work with {{ttb|&lt;}} operator and the result should have standard semantics.

===Requirements===
The type {{tt|T}} satisfies {{named req/core|LessThanComparable}} if given expressions {{c|a}}, {{c|b}} and {{c|c}} of type {{tt|T}}{{rev inl|since=c++11| or {{c/core|const T}}}}, the following expression is valid and has its specified effects:
{|table class=wikitable
|-
!{{nbsp}}Expression{{nbsp}}
!Type
!Effects
|-
|rowspan=2|{{c|a &lt; b}}
|meets {{named req|BooleanTestable}}&lt;br&gt;{{mark until c++20}}
|rowspan=2|Establishes {{enwiki|strict weak ordering}} relation with the following properties:
* For all {{c|a}}, {{c|!(a &lt; a)}} yields {{c|true}}.
* If {{c|a &lt; b}}, then {{c|!(b &lt; a)}}.
* If {{c|a &lt; b}} and {{c|b &lt; c}}, then {{c|a &lt; c}}.
* Defining {{c|equiv(a, b)}} as {{c|!(a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; !(b &lt; a)}}, if {{c|equiv(a, b)}} and {{c|equiv(b, c)}}, then {{c|equiv(a, c)}}.
|-
|models {{lconcept|boolean-testable}}&lt;br&gt;{{mark since c++20}}
|}

===Notes===
To satisfy this requirement, types that do not have built-in [[cpp/language/operator comparison|comparison operators]] have to provide a [[cpp/language/operators#Comparison operators|user-defined {{c/core|operator&lt;}}]].

For the types that are both {{named req|EqualityComparable}} and {{named req/core|LessThanComparable}}, the C++ standard library makes a distinction between
* ''Equality'', which is the value of the expression {{c|1=a == b}} and
* ''Equivalence'', which is the value of the expression {{c|!(a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; !(b &lt; a)}}.
