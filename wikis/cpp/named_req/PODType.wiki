{{cpp/named req/title|PODType|notes={{mark deprecated c++20}}}}
{{cpp/named req/navbar}}
Specifies that the type is POD (Plain Old Data) type. This means the type is compatible with the types used in the C programming language, that is, can be exchanged with C libraries directly, in its binary form. 

{{cpp/named req/core cat note}}

{{rrev|since=c++20|
This type requirement is deprecated in the C++ standard. All of its uses have been replaced by the more refined type requirements, such as {{named req|TrivialType}}, {{named req|ScalarType}}, or {{named req|StandardLayoutType}}.
}}

===Requirements===
The following types are collectively called ''POD types'':
* {{rlp|ScalarType|scalar types}}
* [[cpp/language/classes#POD class|POD classes]]
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types
