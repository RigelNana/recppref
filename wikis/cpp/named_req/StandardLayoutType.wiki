===Requirements===
The following types are collectively called ''standard-layout types'':
* {{rlp|ScalarType|scalar types}}
* [[cpp/language/classes#Standard-layout class|standard-layout class types]]
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types

===Properties===
See {{ls|cpp/language/data members#Standard-layout}}.
