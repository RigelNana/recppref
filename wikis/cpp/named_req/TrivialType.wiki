Specifies that a type is a trivial type.

{{cpp/named req/core cat note}}

===Requirements===
The following types are collectively called ''trivial types'':
* {{rlp|ScalarType|scalar types}}
* [[cpp/language/classes#Trivial class|trivial class types]]
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types

===Notes===
A trivial class may have a private or protected trivial default constructor, in which case an attempt to default-construct such a class object in contexts unrelated to the class makes the program ill-formed.
