{{cpp/named req/core cat note}}

===Requirements===
The following types are collectively called ''implicit-lifetime types'':
* {{rlp|ScalarType|scalar types}}
* [[cpp/language/classes#Implicit-lifetime class|implicit-lifetime class types]]
* array types
* cv-qualified versions of these types

===Notes===
Certain operations may [[cpp/language/object#Object creation|implicitly create]] and start the [[cpp/language/lifetime|lifetime]] of objects of implicit-lifetime types, if doing so would prevent [[cpp/language/ub|undefined behavior]]. However, such operations do not start the lifetimes of subobjects of such objects that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime types.

===Defect reports===
{{dr list begin}}
{{dr list item|wg=cwg|dr=2489|std=C++20|before=an operation that begins the lifetime of a {{c/core|char}} array implicitly creates objects|after=it does not}}
{{dr list end}}
