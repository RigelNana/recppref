The {{named req|TimedLockable}} requirements describe the characteristics of types that provide timed exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents (threads, processes, tasks).

===Requirements===
* {{named req|Lockable}}

For type {{ttb|L}} to be {{named req/core|TimedLockable}}, given
* {{tt|rel_time}}, a value of a specialization of {{lc|std::chrono::duration}}, and
* {{tt|abs_time}}, a value of a specialization of {{lc|std::chrono::time_point}},
the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object {{ttb|m}} of type {{ttb|L}}:

{|table class=wikitable
|-
!Expression!!Effects!!Return value
|-
|{{c|m.try_lock_for(rel_time)}}
|Blocks for the provided duration {{tt|rel_time}} or until a lock on {{ttb|m}} is acquired.
|{{c|true}} if the lock was acquired, {{c|false}} otherwise.
|-
|{{c|m.try_lock_until(abs_time)}}
|Blocks until the provided time point {{tt|abs_time}} is reached or a lock on {{ttb|m}} is acquired.
|{{c|true}} if the lock was acquired, {{c|false}} otherwise.
|}

===Notes===
The {{tt|try_lock_for}} and {{tt|try_lock_until}} member functions obtain a non-shared lock on {{c|m}} on success.

===Standard library===
The following standard library types satisfy {{named req/core|TimedLockable}}:
{{dsc begin}}
{{dsc inc|cpp/thread/dsc timed_mutex}}
{{dsc inc|cpp/thread/dsc recursive_timed_mutex}}
{{dsc inc|cpp/thread/dsc shared_timed_mutex}}
{{dsc end}}
