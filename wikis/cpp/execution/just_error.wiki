A sender factory that returns a sender which completes immediately by calling the receiver’s {{rlpf|set_error}}.

Let {{c|e}} be a subexpression represented by an input error which will be injected and returned by the receiver. The expression {{c|just_error(e)}} is [[cpp/language/expressions#Expression-equivalence|expression-equivalent]] to {{c|/*make-sender*/(just_error, /*product-type*/(e))}}

===Notes===
If the provided error is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent to the receiver’s {{lc|set_error}}. If the provided value is an rvalue reference, it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is sent to the receiver’s {{tt|set_error}}.
