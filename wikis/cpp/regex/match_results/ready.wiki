bool ready() const;
}}

Indicates if the match results are ready (valid) or not.

A default-constructed match result has no result state (is not ''ready''), and can only be made ready by one of the regex algorithms. The ''ready'' state implies that all match results have been fully established.

The result of calling most member functions of the {{tt|match_results}} object that is not ''ready'' is undefined.

===Return value===
{{c|true}} if the match results are ready, {{c|false}} otherwise.

===Example===
{{example
|code=
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;regex&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
    std::string target("big-red-cat");
    std::smatch sm;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Default constructed smatch is "
              &lt;&lt; (sm.ready() ? "ready.\n" : "not ready.\n");

    std::regex re1(".*-red-.*");
    std::regex_search(target, sm, re1);

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "After search, smatch is "
              &lt;&lt; (sm.ready() ? "ready.\n" : "not ready.\n");
}
|output=
Default constructed smatch is not ready.
After search, smatch is ready.
