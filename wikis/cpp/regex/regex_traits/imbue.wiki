Replaces the current locale with a copy of {{c|loc}}. If {{c|loc}} is different than the current locale, then all cached data is invalidated.

After the call {{c|1=getloc() == loc}}.

===Parameters===
{{par begin}}
{{par|loc|the locale to imbue}}
{{par end}}

===Return value===
The current locale of the traits object.

If {{tt|imbue()}} has been never called for this object, then the global locale at the time of the call is returned. Otherwise, the locale passed to the last call to {{tt|imbue()}} is returned.

===Example===
