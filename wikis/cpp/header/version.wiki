{{cpp/header/navbar}}

This header is part of the [[cpp/utility#Language support|language support]] library.

This header supplies implementation-dependent information about the standard library (such as implementation-specific library version macros).

Including {{header|version}} also defines all [[cpp/feature test#Library features|library feature-test macros]].

=== Notes ===
Prior to C++20, including {{header|ciso646}} is sometimes used for this purpose.
