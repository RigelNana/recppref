This header is part of the [[cpp/io|Input/output]] library.

Including {{tt|&lt;iostream&gt;}} behaves as if it defines a static storage duration object of type {{lc|std::ios_base::Init}}, whose constructor initializes the standard stream objects if it is the first {{tt|std::ios_base::Init}} object to be constructed, and whose destructor flushes those objects (except for {{tt|cin}} and {{tt|wcin}}) if it is the last {{tt|std::ios_base::Init}} object to be destroyed.
