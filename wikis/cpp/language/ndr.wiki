{{title|No Diagnostic Required}}
{{cpp/language/navbar}}

"No diagnostic required" indicates that some phraseology is ill-formed according to the language rules, but a compiler need not issue any diagnostic or error message.  Usually, the reason is that trying to detect these situations would result in prohibitively long compile times.

If such a program is executed, [[cpp/language/ub|the behavior is undefined]].
