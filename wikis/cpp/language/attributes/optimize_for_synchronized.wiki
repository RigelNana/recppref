{{cpp/language/attributes/navbar}}

Indicates that the function definition should be optimized for invocation from a [[cpp/language/transactional_memory|synchronized statement]].

===Syntax===
{{sdsc begin}}
{{sdsc|1=
{{ttb|{{c/core|[[optimize_for_synchronized]]}}}}
}}
{{sdsc end}}

===Explanation===
Applies to the name being declared in a function declaration, which must be the first declaration of the function.

Indicates that the function definition should be optimized for invocation from a [[cpp/language/transactional_memory|synchronized statement]]. In particular, it avoids serializing synchronized blocks that make a call to a function that is transaction-safe for the majority of calls, but not for all calls. 

===Example===
{{example
|code=
}}
