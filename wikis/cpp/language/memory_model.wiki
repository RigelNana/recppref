{{title|Memory model}}
{{cpp/language/basics/navbar}}
Defines the semantics of computer memory storage for the purpose of the C++ abstract machine.

The memory available to a C++ program is one or more contiguous sequences of ''bytes''. Each byte in memory has a unique ''address''.

===Byte===
A ''byte'' is the smallest addressable unit of memory. It is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits, large enough to hold
* the value of any {{tt|UTF-8}} code unit (256 distinct values) and of
{{rrev multi
|rev1=
* any member of the {{rlpsd|charset#Basic execution character set}}.
|since2=c++23|rev2=
* the ordinary literal encoding of any element of the {{rlpsd|charset#Basic literal character set}}.
}}
Similar to C, C++ supports bytes of sizes 8 bits and greater.

The {{rlp|types}} {{c/core|char}}, {{c/core|unsigned char}}, and {{c/core|signed char}} use one byte for both storage and {{rlp|object|value representation}}. The number of bits in a byte is accessible as {{lc|CHAR_BIT}} or {{c|std::numeric_limits&lt;unsigned char&gt;::digits}}.

===Memory location===
A ''memory location'' is the storage occupied by the {{rlp|object#Object representation and value representation|object representation}} of either an object of {{rlpsd|type#Scalar type}} that is not a {{rlp|bit field|bit-field}}, or the largest contiguous sequence of bit-fields of non-zero length.

Note: Various features of the language, such as {{rlp|reference}}s and {{rlp|virtual|virtual functions}}, might involve additional memory locations that are not accessible to programs but are managed by the implementation.
